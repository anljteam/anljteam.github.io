 abstract = {We present a general theory for the intrinsic viscosity of flexible
polymers of arbitrary architecture. The theory is based on a partially
permeable sphere model for which we introduce two phenomenological
functions, the drag function xi and the drainage function k, that are
determined by the density profile of the polymer. At the mean-field
level, these functions capture the long-range, multibody, accumulative
hydrodynamic interactions, that are responsible for the frictional
dissipation in and around a polymer. The density profiles for a
diversity of chain architectures are obtained by Monte Carlo simulation.
Predictions from our theory are in good agreement with experimental data
on all the polymer structures examined, ranging from linear, ring, and
stars to hyperbranched and dendrimers. The concepts and methods we
introduce in this work should be useful for studying other dilute
solution frictional properties, such as the self-diffusivity, and
provide a convenient framework for understanding the relationship
between the molecular architecture and their dilute solution properties.},
