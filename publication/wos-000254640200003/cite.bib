 abstract = {Recently a debate about the initial crystallization process which has
not been the hotspot for a long time since the theory proposed by
Hoffman- Lauritzen (LH) dominated the field arose again. For a long time
the Hoffman-Lauritzen model was always confronted by criticism,and some
of the points were taken up and led to modifications, but the foundation
remained unchanged which deemed that before the nucleation and
crystallization the system was uniform. In this article the classical
nucleation and growth theory of polymer crystallization was reviewed,
and the confusion of the explanations to the polymer crystallization
phenomenon was pointed out. LH theory assumes that the growth of
lamellae is by the direct attachment of chain sequences from the melt
onto smooth lateral sides. Whereas, more and more experimental results
show that before the crystallite appears polymer chains go through
conformation adjustment and orientation transformation which favor the
formation of crystallites, i. e. a preordering structure exists before
or at the early stage of polymer crystallization. This is a deviation
from the simple process of nucleation and growth at the early stages of
melt crystallization which can be gone back to Ostwald ` s `` rule of
stagesâ€³. Strobl' s multi-step crystallization mechanism based on
recent SAXS results was summarized in the paper. The theory assumes for
the formation of polymer crystallites, a passage through a transient
mesomorphic phase. It is proposed that the initial step is always the
creation of a mesomorphic layer which starts with an attachment of chain
sequences from the melt onto a growth face of a mesomorphic layer with
minimum thickness and spontaneously thickens,up to a critical value,
where it solidifies through a cooperative structural transition. The
transition produces a granular crystalline layer, which transforms in
the last step into homogeneous lamellar crystallites and this granular
substructure is observed for many semicrystalline polymers.
Crystallization of polymers is controlled by many factors which comprise
of the variation of the main structural parameters such as lamellar
thickness, long spacing, crystallinity with the crystallization
temperature,the structural changes during recrystallization processes
and the temperature dependence of growth rates etc. To expatiate upon
the transforming process among melting, mesophase and lamellae a
thermodynamics scheme was introduced. Many experiments indicate the
existence of mesophase, and the thermodynamic framework by Strobl is
generally feasible for many situations. Indeed, it is the interference
of mesophase which generally dominants polymer crystallization by the
selection of the lamellar thickness. Sirota argued that the granular
structure of the lamellae was itself a fingerprint of the transient
mesophase into which a lamella originally grew, and it was then
converted to the higher-density stable form; and the lower interfacial
energy of the mesophases is connected with their lower density. Based on
Strobl ` s suggestion two crystallization modes of mesophase forming
polymers have been offered which were partitioned by crystallization
rates and only the second case by high rates was deemed to apply to the
Ostwald's rule of stages. In conclusion, it is very important to newly
understand the polymer crystallization process for the thermodynamical
properties of the mesophase between melting and crystallite.},
