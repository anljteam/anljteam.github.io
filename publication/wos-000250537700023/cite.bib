 abstract = {High-affinity K+ transporters play an important role in K+ absorption of
plants. We isolated a HAK gene from Aeluropus littoralis, a graminaceous
halophyte. The amino acid sequence of AlHAK showed high homology with
HAK transporters obtained from Oryza sativa (82%) and Hordeum vulgare
(82%). When expressed in Saccharomyces cereviae W Delta 3, AlHAK
performed high-affinity K+ uptake with a K-m value of 8 mu M, and the
growth of transformants was dramatically inhibited by 150 mM Rb+ and 150
mM Cs+ but less affected by 300 mM Na+. AlHAK may thus improve the
capacity of plants to maintain a high cytosolic K+/Na+ ratio at high
salinity.},
