 abstract = {The dynamics of individual ring polymers in a shear flow is studied by a
hybrid mesoscale simulation approach. New insight into the dynamics of
ring polymers is provided: ring polymers exhibit both tumbling and
tank-treading motions. A novel angle autocorrelation function is
proposed to analyze the tank-treading motion that usually coexists with
tumbling and may be applied to other highly deformable soft objects such
as vesicles. The shear dependence of the average gyration tensor, the
orientation angle, the tumbling and the tank-treading frequencies is
determined quantitatively. The simulations also reveal that the
existence of the tank-treading motion apparently increases the intrinsic
viscosity of ring polymers under shear flow.},
