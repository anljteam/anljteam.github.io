 abstract = {The crystalline morphology and structure of poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) in a
PLLA film-chloroform system were investigated by means of wide angle
X-ray diffraction (WAXD), polarized optical microscopy (POM) and atomic
force microscopy (AFM). Birefringent and nonbirefringent ring banded
supra-structures with radial periodic variation of thickness were
obtained, which were induced by micro-evaporation of solvents and
concentration gradient of PLLA. The ring banded morphologies consisted
of multilayer lamellar crystals, which is a manifestation of alternating
ridge and valley bands of periodic variation of thicknesses along the
radial direction. The formation of the ring banded supra-structures is
associated with diffusion and crystal growth induced periodic variation
of concentration gradient, which is attributed to diffusion-related
rhythmic growth and the competition between diffusion of polymer
segments and growth of crystal lamellae. The mechanism of such
banded-ring formation was explored on the basis of rhythmic growth
resulting from non-linear diffusion.},
