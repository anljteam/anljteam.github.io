 abstract = {In order to optimize reactive processing conditions and synthesize
polymer materials according to requirements a kinetic model of free
radical polymerization of n-butylmethacrylate (n-BMA) In
counter-rotating twin screw extruders was constructed mainly on the
basis of the entanglement theory,and then the numerical calculation
expressions of the monomer concentration, the monomer conversion, the
average molecular weight and the apparent viscosity were deduced.
Consequently, the free radical polymerization process of n-BMA in
counter-rotating twin screw extruders was numerically simulated by means
of the finite volume method and an uncoupled semi-implicit iterative
algorithm, and then the evolution characteristics and the influencing
factors of different variables like monomer conversion, average
molecular weight and fluid viscosity were discussed in detail. A
comparison of the monomer conversion as well as the weight-average
molecular weight between the simulated results and the experimental
results shows a nearly good agreement,which indicates that the
constructed model is reasonable.},
