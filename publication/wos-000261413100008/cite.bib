 abstract = {A mutant designated as UV-3 was obtained from wild-type Enterobacter
aerogenes 10293 through u.v. radiation. The activities of
alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase (Ald), lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh) and
diacetyl reductase (Dr) in UV-3 were strongly attenuated, with the
lowest activities at pH 7.0-7.5, and temperature between 36 and 39c
degrees. Compared to the wild-type, the yield of diacetyl by UV-3 was
increased 18.7-fold, up to 1.05 +/- 0.01 g l(-1). Acetoin and ethanol
productions were decreased by 48.4 and 71.4%, respectively, but acetate
yield was increased by 34.6%. Optimum medium for diacetyl production by
UV-3 contained 10% glucose, 0.5% peptone, 0.5% yeast extract powder,
0.01% (NH4)(2)SO4, 0.1% citric acid, 0.2% MnSO4 and 0.2% MgSO4, and
this was determined by one-factor-at-a-time approach. Data from the five
level central composite designs demonstrated that initial pH of 7.0,
temperature of 37 degrees C and rotational speed of 180 rev/min were
optimum processing parameters for diacetyl production. The maximum yield
of diacetyl could reach 1.35 g l(-1) in a 5-l bioreactor. These results
showed an enhancement of the non-enzymatic oxidative decarboxylation of
alpha-acetolactate and a decrease in the activities of Ald, Ldh and Dr
as a consequence of diacetyl accumulation in UV-3.},
