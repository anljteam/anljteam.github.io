 abstract = {The effects of nanorods on the structural, dynamical, and rheological
properties of polymer matrix were investigated under shear flow via
nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation. By comparing the results
of nanocomposites(with volume fractions from 0.8% to 10%)and pure
melts, it is found that the diffusion and relaxation of polymer chains
are gradually limited with the increase of nanoparticles, while the
poly. mer size keeps almost unchanged. Under shear flow, it is found
that the structural properties such as the mean-square radius of
gyration, main components of gyration tensor and the orientation
resistance parameter are almost independent of the volume fractions of
nanoparticles, from the perspective of Weissenberg number (W-i), while
the tumbling motion of polymer chains is restricted. In addition, we
also find the shear viscosity curve of nanocomposites is essentially the
same with that of the pure melt, that is, W-i=1 divides the curve into
the plateau region and the shear thinning region. The introduction of
nanorods merely changes the shear viscosity of the fluid quantitatively.},
