 abstract = {The effects of the glass-bead content and size on the nonisothermal
crystallization behavior of polypropylene (PP)/glass-bead blends were
studied with differential scanning calorimetry. The degree of
crystallinity decreased with the addition of glass bead, and the
crystallization temperature of the blends was marginally higher than
that of pure PP at various cooling rates. Furthermore, the half-time for
crystallization decreased with an increase in the glass-bead content or
particle size, implying the nucleating role of the glass beads. The
nonisothermal crystallization data were analyzed with the methods of
Avrami, Ozawa, and Mo. The validity of various kinetic models for the
nonisothermal crystallization process of PP/glass-bead blends was
examined. The approach developed by Mo successfully described the
nonisothermal crystallization behavior of PP and PP/glass-bead blends.
Finally, the activation energy for the nonisothermal crystallization of
pure PP and PP/glass-bead blends based on the Kissinger method was
evaluated. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
