 abstract = {Memory effects play an important role in understanding polymer
crystallization, especially for self-seeding or self-nucleation of
polymer crystallization. Amorphous poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) was
prepared via quenching after holding at various temperatures. Melt
structure and cold crystallization behaviour of PLLA were explored by
WAXD, DSC, and FTIR. Both isothermal and non-isothermal cold
crystallization behaviours of PLLA show obvious melting memory effects.
WAXD profiles and FTIR spectrums indicate that various conformations of
the prepared amorphous samples can be distinguished. Fewer entanglements
of polymer melt may promote molecular chain motions when holding at
lower temperatures and facilitate the subsequent crystallization. The
melt memory effect plays a role as ``self-plasticization″ rather than
``self-nucleation″. Real-time FTIR implies the amorphous
conformational differences originate from the fresh formed melt
structure more than the possibly retained crystal structure. The melt
memory effect is a memory of temperature-related dynamic competition of
the chain conformations developed in the melting process and the
self-nucleated melt is in the metastable heterogeneous state, which may
be the origin of the unerased melt memory effect above the equilibrium
melting point.},
