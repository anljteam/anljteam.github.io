 abstract = {A 1312 bp 5' flanking region of Salicornia europaea choline
monooxygenase (SeCMO) gene was isolated using the anchored PCR. To
investigate the mechanism of regulation for this stress-induced gene,
the SeCMO promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) chimeric gene constructs
containing five deletions F1, F2, F3, F4 and F5 were introduced into
tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation.
The functional properties of each promoter fragment were examined by
assaying GUS activity in the leaves of transgenic tobacco treated with
abiotic stresses (NaCl, PEG6000 and low temperature). The GUS activity
in transgenic tobacco with F2 (-1056 to +8) construct showed highest
increase under all the three abiotic stresses. Thus, the study provided
a potential promoter induced by the salt, dehydration and cold for the
plant genetic manipulation.},
