 abstract = {Water dissolved in ionic liquids garners particular attention in
electrochemistry, as represented by the case where water molecules
cannot be completely removed from ionic liquids. Nevertheless, the
effects of such polarizable polar molecules on the energy efficiency of
electrochemical devices remain elusive. Thus, we highlight the effects
of the spatially varying dielectric response of water and ionic liquid
near charged plates using a coarse-grained mean-field theory that
simultaneously accounts for both the permanent and induced dipole
moments of the species and the strong electrostatic correlation. We show
that water can be adsorbed onto electrodes primarily because of the
dielectric contrast between the species. Our results predict that
linear-dielectric theory is inadequate to account for the correlation
between the capacitance and dielectric contrast, which may be fitted by
exponential functions. Electronic polarizability can enhance the
capacitance. A higher-dielectric component preferentially solvates
electrodes, but this effect competes with that of the charge screening.
Our theory shows that strong electrostatic correlation causes the
dipolar cation and anion to form alternating layers, which in turn
yields substantial increases in the capacitance. Our results compare
favorably with previous molecular dynamics simulations.},
