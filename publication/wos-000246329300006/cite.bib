 abstract = {A novel fluorescent dye labeled H-shaped block copolymer,
(PMMA-Fluor-PS)(2)-PEO-(PS-Fluor-PMMA)(2), is synthesized by the
combination of atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and anionic
polymerization (AP). To obtain the designated structure of the
copolymer, a macroinitiator, 2,2-dichloro acetyl-PEO-2,2-dichloro acetyl
(DCA-PEO-DCA), was prepared from DCAC and poly(ethylene oxide). The
copolymer was characterized by H-1 NMR, GPC and fluorescence
spectroscopy. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
