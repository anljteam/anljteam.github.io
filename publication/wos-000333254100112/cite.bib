 abstract = {Larvae of the Chinese oak silkmoth (Antheraea pernyi) are often affected
by AVD (A. pernyi vomiting disease), whose causative agent has long been
suspected to be a virus. In an unrelated project we discovered a novel
positive sense single-stranded RNA virus that could reproduce AVD
symptoms upon injection into healthy A. pernyi larvae. The genome of
this virus is 10,163 nucleotides long, has a natural poly-A tail, and
contains a single, large open reading frame flanked at the 5' and 3'
ends by untranslated regions containing putative structural elements for
replication and translation of the virus genome. The open reading frame
is predicted to encode a 3036 amino acid polyprotein with four viral
structural proteins (VP1-VP4) located in the N-terminal end and the
non-structural proteins, including a helicase, RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase and 3C-protease, located in the C-terminal end of the
polyprotein. Putative 3C-protease and autolytic cleavage sites were
identified for processing the polyprotein into functional units. The
genome organization, amino acid sequence and phylogenetic analyses
suggest that the virus is a novel species of the genus Iflavirus, with
the proposed name of Antheraea pernyi Iflavirus (ApIV).},
