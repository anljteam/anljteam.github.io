 abstract = {Micro-failure modes and statistical fragment lengths in the hybrid fiber
and non-hybrid reference composites in the uniaxial tension were
investigated. Similiar to the reference experiments, fibers in hybrid
strong interface/medium interface fiber composites display a decrease in
aspect ratio and an increase in interfacial shear stress (IFSS) with the
increase of inter-fiber spacing. While for the fibers with weak
interfaces in the hybrid strong interface/weak interface fiber
composites, the aspect ratio increases and IFSS decreases with
enlargement of inter-fiber spacing, which is contrary to other systems.
Finite element numerical analysis was used to interpret the special
phenomena. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
