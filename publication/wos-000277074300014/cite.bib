 abstract = {The aim of this work was to evaluate the mechanisms involved in the
effects of catalpol on mitochondrial function through the measurements
of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production, respiratory complex activities and mitochondrial membrane
potential (MMP) in the brain cortex and hippocampus mitochondria of
senescent mice induced by D-galactose. Except control group, mice were
subcutaneously injected with D-galactose (150 mg/kg body weight) for 6
weeks. Meanwhile, drug group mice were treated with catalpol (2.5,5, 10
mg/kg body weight) and piracetam (300 mg/kg body weight) for the last 2
weeks. The results indicated that respiratory complex activities
decreased while NOS activities increased in D-galactose treated mice
brain. The production of ROS increased remarkably and MMP collapsed in
the brain of senescent mice induced by ID-galactose. Administration of
catalpol for 2 weeks significantly decreased ROS production and NOS
activities, in accordance with its increase on complex activities and
MMP level. Our results suggest that in vivo effects of catalpol on
mitochondrial function can occur through different mechanisms, involving
inhibiting NOS activity and ROS production, increasing respiratory
complex activities and MMP level. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All
