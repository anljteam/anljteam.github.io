 abstract = {The increasing use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in biomedical applications
underlines the importance of its potential toxic effects to human
health. In the present study, we first exposed PC12 cells, a commonly
used in vitro model for neurotoxicity study, to two kinds of
commercially available single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), to
investigate the effect of SWCNTs on nervous system in vitro. The
decrease of PC12 cells viability was time and dose-dependent with
exposure to SWCNTs demonstrated by
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assay, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and morphological
observation. Flow cytometry analysis showed that the PC12 cells' cycle
was arrested in the G2/M phase, and their apoptotic rate induced by
SWCNTs was dose-dependent. Further studies revealed SWCNTs decreased
mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), induced the formation of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased the level of lipid peroxide
and decreased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione
peroxidase (GSH-Px). catalase (CAT) and the content of glutathione (GSH)
in a time and dose-dependent manner. These findings reveal that SWCNTs
may induce oxidative stress to nervous system in vivo, causing the
occurrence of diseases related to cellular injuries of neuronal cells,
such as neurodegenerative disorders, and demonstrating the necessity of
further research in vivo. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
