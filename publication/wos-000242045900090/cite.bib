 abstract = {By using a combinatorial screening method based on the self-consistent
field theory, we investigate the equilibrium morphologies of linear
ABCBA and H-shaped (AB)(2)C(BA)(2) block copolymers in two dimensions.
The triangle phase diagrams of both block copolymers are constructed by
systematically varying the volume fractions of blocks A, B, and C. In
this study, the interaction energies between species A, B, and C are set
to be equal. Four different equilibrium morphologies are identified,
i.e., the lamellar phase (LAM), the hexagonal lattice phase (HEX), the
core-shell hexagonal lattice phase (CSH), and the two interpenetrating
tetragonal lattice phase (TET2). For the linear ABCBA block copolymer,
the reflection symmetry is observed in the phase diagram except for some
special grid points, and most of grid points are occupied by LAM
morphology. However, for the H-shaped (AB)(2)C(BA)(2) block copolymer,
most of the grid points in the triangle phase diagram are occupied by
CSH morphology, which is ascribed to the different chain architectures
of the two block copolymers. These results may help in the design of
block copolymers with different microstructures.},
