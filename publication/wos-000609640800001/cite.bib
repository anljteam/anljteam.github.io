 abstract = {Bud dormancy of deciduous fruit trees is a complex process that allows
trees to survive long periods in adverse conditions during winter.
Dormancy is a major obstacle for both fruit production in mild winter
areas and off-season culture of fruit trees in protection facilities. It
is very economically advantageous to be able to control the time point
of bud break and consequently harvest in crops with high returns and
short harvest seasons like blueberry (Vaccinium spp.). Hydrogen
cyanamide (H2CN2 (HC)) treatment is an effective method to promote
dormancy release and synchronize bud break in perennial deciduous fruit
trees, including blueberry. However, there are few systematic studies of
the metabolic changes that occur during HC-induced bud breaking. In this
study, the metabolome of blueberry buds under forced conditions
following HC and water treatment (control) was analyzed using gas
chromatography paired with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS)
technology. A total of 252 metabolites were identified and 16
differential metabolites (VIP > 1, p < 0.05) were detected. The levels
of several soluble sugars (fructose, glucose, maltose), organic acids
(citric acid, alpha-ketoglutaric, succinic acid), and amino acids
(aspartic acid, glutamic acid, phenylalanine) were upregulated, while
tyrosine, tryptophan, and asparagine were significantly downregulated in
HC-treated buds when compared with control buds. The synthesis and
accumulation of phenylpropanoids (salicin, 4-vinylphenol, neohesperidin)
were also promoted by HC. These results suggest that alteration of
carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
increase, and phenylpropanoid accumulation were crucial in HC-promoted
bud breaking in blueberry. This research extends our understanding of
the mechanisms involved in dormancy release induced by HC and provides a
theoretical basis for applying HC to accelerate bud break.},
