 abstract = {The amino acid residues participating in the active site of the
extracellular thermostable endo-inulinase from Bacillus smithii T7 were
investigated by chemical modification. The results show that there are
one histidine residue and one carboxylate residue in the active site.
The kinetic study of the enzyme before and after modification by
diethylpyrocarbonate and carbodiimide showed that one histidine residue
might play a key role in substrate binding and catalysis, and one
carboxylate residue located in the active site may act as a nucleophile
base for the cleavage of substrate. The Tsou's plot analysis indicated
that the inactivation of the enzyme is dependent upon the modification
of two essential tryptophan residues. Fluorescence and circular
dichroism spectroscopy assays and the thermal inactivation study of the
modified enzyme also confirmed that tryptophan residues play an
important role in the catalysis and thermal stability of the inulinase.},
