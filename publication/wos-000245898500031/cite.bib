 abstract = {The anionic copolymerization process of styrene-buradiene (S/B) block
copolymer in a closely intermeshing co-rotating twin screw extruder with
butyl-lithium initiator was studied. According to the anionic
copolymerization mechanism and the reactive extrusion characteristics,
the mathematical models of monomer conversion, average molecular weight
and fluid viscosity during the anionic copolymerization of S/B were
constructed, and then the reactive extrusion process was simulated by
means of the finite volume method and the uncoupled semi-implicit
iterative algorithm. Finally, the influence of the feeding mixture
composition on conversion was discussed. The simulated results were
nearly in agreement with the experimental results. (C) 2006 Elsevier
