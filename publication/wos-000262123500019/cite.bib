 abstract = {A tissue culture-independent plant transformation method, called
ovary-drip transformation, was established in which a minimal linear
gene cassette [35S CaMV promoter, open reading frame of soluble
modified green fluorescent protein (smGFP), and NOS terminator] was
transformed into soybean. The method is characterized by directly
dripping a DNA solution, which is supplemented with a surfactant, onto
the ovary wound 6-8 h after self-pollination. The growth of the pollen
tube was measured after self-pollination. The movement of smGFP across
the passageway toward the embryo sac was monitored using fluorescein
isothiocyanate-labeled DNA. The transformation frequency reached 3.2%
by PCR analysis. Southern analysis of the primary transformants denoted
the integration of a single site smGFP. The transgenic plants exhibited
a high level of smGFP expression which was visible in the immature
embryos of the transgenic soybean.},
