 abstract = {The slippage effect of the polymer chains is investigated in the
dewetting process of the polymer solution film. The solvent-induced
dewetting is used in our experiments to study the dynamics of hole
growth in the dewetting process of the polymer solution film. Our
results show that in the case of the low molecular weight polystyrene
(PS) film, the slippage effect of the polymer chains is not displayed
and the radius of the holes is R similar to exp(t/tau); in the case of
the higher molecular weight PS film, the slippage effect of the polymer
chain is not valid in the case of the thin film and that is valid in the
case of the thick film, and the dynamic process of hole growth divides
into three stages (R similar to t, and then R similar to t(x) (2/3 < x <
1), finally, R similar to t). Besides, the solvent and substrate
properties also influence the dewetting dynamics of the polymer solution
film. (c) 2008 American Institute of Physics.},
