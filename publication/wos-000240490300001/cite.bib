 abstract = {The functional polystyrene, (Cl-PS)(2)-CHCOOCH2CH2OH ( designated as
XPSt and coded P2) was prepared by ATRP at 130(0)C using CuCl and
bipyridine as catalysts, 2,2-dichloro acetate-ethylene glycol (DCAG) as
multifunctional initiator and THF as solvent. 4-Nitoroaniline
azomethine-4' phenol (P1) as chromophores were covalently linked to the
functional end groups of the polymer by using simple displacement
reaction. The functional polystyrenes, namely XPSt (P2) and
(PS)(2)-CHCOOCH2CH2OH, designated as X-PSt and coded P3 and their
post-derivatives, namely, DXPSt (P4) and DX-PSt (P5) respectively were
characterized by IR, NMR and UV spectroscopies, gel permeation
chromatography (GPC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarising optical microscopy
(POM) and XRD studies. DSC showed that incorporation of chromophores in
the side chains of polymers towards the polystyrene moiety increases the
rigidity of the polymer and subsequently, its glass transition
temperature; however the incorporation of side chain towards the
alcoholic functional group decreases the glass transition temperature.
The post derivatives do not play any significant role to increase the
thermal stability ( TGA). There was evidence for liquid crystalline
properties in the resulting polymer derivative DXPSt ( P4) as observed
from POM study, which defines the alignment of chromophores into the
polymers. The XRD study shows crystalline behaviour of the polymer
derivative, P4. The polymer derivative, DXPSt ( P5) does not show such
behaviour and this may be due to the bonding of azomethine towards the
short chain alcoholic telechelic alcoholic sides of the copolymer.},
