 abstract = {Crystallization behavior of sheared polymer melts of a series of
poly(ethylene-co-octene)s with different octene content was investigated
by different scanning calorimetry (DSC), wide angle X-ray diffraction
(WAXD) and synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SR-SAXS)
techniques. The DSC results indicated that the hexyl branches content
had dramatic effects on the thermal properties and crystallinity of
polyethylene. It was also found that shear had no obvious effects on the
size of either crystallite or lamellae. However, both crystallite and
lamellae were oriented by shearing, especially for the lamellae. All
obtained results indicate that the initial states of the polymer melt
play an important role in affecting the crystallization behaviors. The
difference of the shear-induced crystalline structure evolution and the
orientation between crystallite and lamellae support the preordered
mesomorphic phase of flexible polymer crystallization process proposed
by Strobl.},
