 abstract = {The crystallization behaviors and morphology of asymmetric
crystalline-crystalline diblock copolymers poly(ethylene oxide-lactide)
(PEO-b-PLLA) were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC), wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), and microscopic techniques
(polarized optical microscopy (POM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM)).
Both blocks of PEO5-b-PLLA(16) can be crystallized, which was confirmed
by WAXD, while PEO block in PEO5-b-PLLA(30) is difficult to crystallize
because of the confinement induced by the high glass transition
temperature and crystallization of PLLA block with the microphase
separation of the block copolymer. Comparing with the crystallization
and morphology of PLLA homopolymer and differences between the two
copolymers, we studied the influence of PEO block and microphase
separation on the crystallization and morphology of PLLA block. The
boundary temperature (T-b) was observed, which distinguishes the
crystallization into high- and low-temperature ranges, the growth rate
and morphology were quite different between the ranges. Crystalline
morphologies including banded spherulite, dendritic crystal, and dense
branching in PEO5-b-PLLA(16) copolymer were formed. The typical
morphology of dendritic crystals including two different sectors were
observed in PEO5-b-PLLA(30) copolymer, which can be explained by
secondary nucleation, chain growth direction, and phase separation
between the two blocks during the crystallization process.
Lozenge-shaped crystals of PLLA with screw dislocation were also
observed employing AFM, but the crystalline morphology of PEO block was
not observed using microscopy techniques because of its small size. (C)
