 abstract = {Catalpol has been shown to rescue neurons from kinds of damage in vitro
and in vivo in previous reports. However, the effect of catalpol on the
nitric oxide (NO) system via MAPKs signaling pathway of mesencephalic
neurons largely remains to be verified. The current study examined that
whether catalpol modulated NO and iNOS increase by rotenone in primary
mesencephalic neurons and investigated its underlying signaling
pathways. Present results indicated that catalpol inhibited primary
mesencephalic neurons from apoptosis by morphological assay,
immunocytochemistry and flow cytometric evaluation. Moreover, the ERK
signaling pathway plays an important role in NO-mediated degeneration of
neuron. The current results suggest that catalpol is a potential agent
for the prevention of neurons apoptosis by regulating NO and iNOS
increase in ERK-mediated neurodegenerative disorders. (C) 2008 Elsevier
