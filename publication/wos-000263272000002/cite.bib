 abstract = {The synthesis of monodisperse nanocrystals is an important topic in the
field of nanomaterials not only for practical applications, but also for
scientific interest in fundamental research. In this feature article, we
mainly focus on synthesis of monodisperse nanocrystals by a two-phase
approach without the separation of nucleation and growth processes, and
report some progress made recently in the observation and understanding
of nucleation and growth of semiconductor nanocrystals. Firstly, a novel
two-phase approach to monodisperse nanocrystals, which is different from
the well-established synthesis models, is discussed. We demonstrate that
the two-phase approach has a quite lengthy nucleation process, and can
be applied to the synthesis of many kinds of binary monodisperse
nanocrystals. Then, we provide a summary of recent research progress in
the observation and understanding of nucleation and growth of
semiconductor nanocrystals in one-phase and two-phase systems, and
compare the nucleation and growth mechanisms of the two kinds of
reaction systems. Although the lengthy nucleation process of the
two-phase approach enables researchers to capture some useful
information about the nucleation and growth processes, and the
nucleation and growth processes have been studied by optical absorption
spectra and transmission electron microscopy, there is little or no
experimental data available on the atomic configurations of critical
nuclei. Finally, the current difficulties and future challenges in
synthesis and structural characterization of critical nuclei are
presented.},
