 abstract = {In order to deal with the complicated relationships among the variables
of the reactive extrusion process for activated anionic polymerization,
a three-dimensional equivalent model of closely intermeshing co-rotating
twin screw extruders was established. Then the numerical computation
expressions of the monomer concentration, the monomer conversion, the
average molecular weight and the fluid viscosity were deduced, and the
numerical simulation of the reactive extrusion process of Styrene was
carried out. At last, our simulated results were compared with
Michaeli's simulated results and experimental results. (C) 2007 Elsevier
