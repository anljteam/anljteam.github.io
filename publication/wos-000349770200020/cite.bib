 abstract = {The Chinese oak silkworm, Antheraea pernyi, is an economically important
insect of the Saturniidae family. In this study, genome walking was
performed to obtain an A. pernyi actin promoter, which can be employed
in transgenic or stable cell line expression systems. The putative
promoter was analyzed by the online promoter analysis programs at the
Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project and the Web Promoter Scan Service,
which led to the recognition of several functional elements. With
respect to these elements, a series of actin A1 promoter fragments with
5'-deletions were generated that were then used to construct different
vectors expressing Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). The plasmids were
transfected into Sf9 cells and GFP expression was determined by
observing GFP fluorescence in cells and by measuring GFP mRNA levels
with real-time polymerase chain reaction. Sequence comparisons indicated
that the sequence cloned from A. pernyi was the actin A1 promoter. The
basic function of the promoter was verified by constructing expression
vectors and observing GFP expression. In addition, real-time polymerase
chain reaction revealed a strong inhibitory element may exist upstream
of the TATA box, which downregulated gene expression. The actin A1
promoter is an ideal candidate for use in A. pernyi transgenic systems.},
