 abstract = {A physical gel is a three-dimensional network of polymer chains
cross-linked by physical junctions, and it can arise either as the
result of a phase transition or through some specific molecular
association or as a result of entanglements. Due to the complexity of
the inner structure and gelation mechanism, it is difficult to obtain
purposefully polymer physical gel materials with specific constitution
and properties. Thus, the controllable preparation and application of
polymer physical gels are a long-term work. As a numerical simulation
method in macro-scale the finite element method has been used to the
study of chemical gelation,but rarely to physical gelation presently.
The reasons may be: compared with chemical gels the gelation process of
physical gels is more complex resulting from the bigger complexity of
the system composition and physical interactions. Several kinds of
interactions and steps may be involved in one physical gelation proeess.
And under different conditions the gelation mechanisms are frequently
different. By now the understanding of the gelation mechanisms of many
kinds of physical gels is far from being intensive; the phenomenological
gelation kinetics models are usually nonlinear; the theory describing
the relation between the microscopic and mesoscopic structure and the
macroscopic properties is still immature. For all the factors mentioned
above the numerical simulation of physical gelation process in
macro-scale comes to be a difficult work. In order to optimize raw
material formulation and physical gelation conditions, and then obtain
polymer physical gels according to requirements, the spatial
distribution and time evolution characteristics of the temperature field
during the gelation process were studied via the finite element method.
On the basis of the temperature field calculated, the complex shear
modulus field of gel system was numerically simulated according to a
first-order gelation kinetic equation, and the effects of raw material
concentration, sample size and cooling modes on the physical gelation
were discussed. Rennet casein gel is a kind of particle gel, whose
formation is controlled by physical forces including steric-hydration
force and van der Waals force, and whose structure and properties are
influenced by many parameters including emulsifying salts I pH, thermal
and shear history. The formation process of the gel network can be
divided into three steps, molecules-particles-flocs-network. Casein
floes are fractal objects that can be partially filled by the
constructing units (particles). The fractal dimension of the floes and
the size of the particles are two important parameters determining the
gel microscopic structure and rheological properties. Experimental
results show that cooling modes will influence the rheological
properties of the gel through influencing the size of the particles. The
formation of rennet casein gels is a first-order kinetics process. Three
examples were studied. The raw material concentrations of example I and
example 2 are both 18% but the sample size of the former is five times
as that of the latter; the raw material concentration of example 3 is
25%, and the sample size is same with example 1. The gel zone is
divided into 136 unites and 163 nodes; the prototype zone is divided
into 28 unites and 40 nodes; four representative nodes were selected in
the gel zone, and were emphatically studied.
The initial system temperature is set at 80 degrees C and cooling modes
Include (I) environmental temperature declines from 80 degrees C to 5
degrees C and cooling rates are espectively 0.5 K/min, 0.25 K/min, 0.1
K/min, 0.05 K/min, 0.025 K/min; (2) environmental temperature maintains
5 degrees C. The simulated results show that ( I) the rate of
temperature decrease near the surface is larger than that near the
center the gelation occurs on the surface first; as the infinite complex
shear modulus is determined by the cooling rate of the pre-gelation
phase, the value of the complex shear modulus of the interior exceeds
that of the exterior finally. The asymmetric distribution of temperature
field results in the asymmetric distribution of mechanical property
field of the gel. And with the increase of environmental cooling rate
and sample size the asymmetry becomes more obvious.},
