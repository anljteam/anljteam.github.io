 abstract = {A mathematical model of the chemical kinetics of silicone rubber
Vulcanization is developed, with the thermal effects being computed
using the increment method, and the hot Vulcanization process estimated
with the finite element method. The results show that the reaction heat
of rubber vulcanization is important for energy saving, and that a
proper curing medium temperature is important when considering both
vulcanization efficiency and vulcanizate uniformity. The results also
indicate that increases in the forced convective heat transfer
coefficient have no significant effect above a certain level. The
validity of the numerical model is indirectly proven by comparison with
existing data.},
