 abstract = {Broad spectrum Bcl-2 small molecule inhibitors act as BH3 mimetics are
effective antitumor agents. Herein, we have identified S1, a previously
discovered small molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor, as the first authentic BH3
mimetic as well as a dual, nanomolar inhibitor of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 (K-i =
310 nM and 58 nM, respectively). The results of fluorescence
polarization assays, coimmunoprecipitation, fluorescent resonance energy
transfer, and shRNA indicated that S1 can disrupt Bcl-2/Bax, Mcl-1/Bak
and Bcl-2/Bim heterodimerization in multiple cell lines, activate Bax
accompanied by its translocation to mitochondrial, activate caspase 3
completely dependent on Bax/Bak, and in turn induce a Bim-independent
apoptosis. Moreover, S1 could induce apoptosis on the primary acute
lymphoblastic leukemia cells regardless of Mcl-1 level. Mechanism-based
single agent antitumor activity in a mouse xenograft H22 (mouse liver
carcinoma) model ascertain its therapeutic potential. S1 represents a
novel chemical class of antitumor leads that function solely as BH3
mimetics and pan-Bcl-2 inhibitors. In the meanwhile, S1 could become a
unique tool for interactions between Bcl-2 family proteins.},
