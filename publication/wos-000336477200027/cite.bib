 abstract = {By using nonequilibrium Monte Carlo simulation approach, the shearing
effects on the sol-gel transition of ABA telechelic triblock copolymers
in a B block selective solvent were investigated. The simulation results
show that the shear makes the sol-gel transition concentration area
shifting to lower concentrations. Microscopic structure properties of
the solution under shearing were simulated, such as the fractions of
chains with different conformations, micelle aggregation number and
micelle number, cluster aggregation number and cluster number, average
size of a single chain and the stretching degree of chains. The shear
makes polymer chains stretched, so telechelic chains have more
opportunity to form bridge conformation, which might be the reason why a
certain extent shear promotes the sol-gel transition process.},
