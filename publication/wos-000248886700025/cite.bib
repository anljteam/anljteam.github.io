 abstract = {The process of nonsolvent-induced dewetting of thin polystyrene (PS)
films on hydrophilic surfaces at room temperature has been studied by
using water as a nonsolvent. It is observed that the process of
nonsolvent-induced dewetting is greatly different from other previous
dewetting processes. The PS film is found in nonviscous state in our
study. A mechanism of nonsolvent-induced dewetting is deduced in an
order of penetration, replacement, and coalescent, and it is different
from other previous dewetting mechanisms. The results of experiments are
analyzed from thermodynamics and dynamics to support the hypothetical
mechanism.},
