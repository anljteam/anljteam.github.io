 abstract = {The evolution of morphologies of isothermally crystallized thin films
with different thicknesses of poly(L-lactide-bethylene oxide) diblock
copolymer was observed by optical microscopy (OM) and atomic force
microscopy (AFM). Dendritic superstructures stacked with lamellae were
investigated in thin films with similar to 200 nm to similar to 400 nm
thickness. The lamellar structure was a lozenge- or
truncated-lozenge-shaped single crystal of PLLA confirmed by AFM
observations. The contour of the dendritic superstructures is hexagonal,
and two types of sectors, [110] and [100], can be classified in
terms of the chain-folding and crystal growth directions. These
phenomena Are due to the interplay of the crystallization of the PLLA
block, the microphase separation of the block copolymer, and the effect
of the film thickness. The growth process of the superstructure can be
classified into three steps: the growth of the main branches. the growth
of the secondary side branches along the main branch, and the tertiary
side branches. PLLA growth rates decrease in copolymer films thinner
than 1 mu m. Layer-layer phase structure of the copolymer driven by the
crystallization of PLLA and the microphase separation of the copolymer
appears to be a key factor explaining the crystallization and
morphological behavior of this system.},
