 abstract = {The gelation behavior of polypeptide-polyelectrolyte-polypeptide in
solution is investigated by Monte Carlo techniques. It is found that
different hydrogen bonding styles, parallel and antiparallel, provide a
major influence on the sol-gel transition and the chain conformation.
The antiparallel hydrogen bonding style favors the bridge conformation,
while loop conformation has less structural limitation with parallel
bonding. However, in the parallel style, polyelectrolyte blocks are
aligned in the same side of beta-sheets, which induces more steric
constrains and the electrostatic repulsion. Consequently, compared with
the parallel bonding style, the sol-gel transition of antiparallel style
occurs at lower hydrogen bonding energy and the dihedral angle theta of
antiparallel beta-sheets is a little higher. The increase of charging
fraction of polyelectrolyte blocks prompts the sol-gel transition of
both bonding styles but causes an impact on the number of hydrogen bond
and the dihedral angle, indicating a decrease in the structure
integrity.},
