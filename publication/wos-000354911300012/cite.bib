 abstract = {We apply Monte Carlo simulation to explore the adsorption of a
positively charged polyelectrolyte on a lipid monolayer membrane,
composed of electronically neutral, monovalent anionic and mulvitalent
anionic phospholipids. We systematically assess the influence of various
factors, including the intrinsic rigidity of the polyelectrolyte chain,
the bead charge density of the polyelectrolyte, and the ionic strength
of the saline solution, on the interfacial structural properties of the
polyelectrolyte/monolayer complex. The enhancement of the
polyelectrolyte chain intrinsic rigidity reduces the polyelectrolyte
conformational entropy loss and the energy gains in electrostatic
interaction, but elevates the segregated anionic lipid demixing entropy
loss. This energy-entropy competition results in a nonmonotonic
dependence of the polyelectrolyte/monolayer association strength on the
degree of chain rigidity. The semiflexible polyelectrolyte, i.e., the
one with an intermediate degree of chain rigidity, is shown to associate
onto the ternary membane below a higher critical ionic concentration. In
this ionic concentration regime, the semiflexible polyelectrolyte binds
onto the monolayer more firmly than the pancake-like flexible one and
exhibits a stretched conformation. When the chain is very rigid, the
polyelectrolyte with bead charge density Z(b) = +1 exhibits a larger
tail and tends to dissociate from the membrane, whereas the one with
Z(b) = +2 can still bind onto the membrane in a bridge-like
conformation. Our results imply that chain intrinsic rigidity serves as
an efficient molecular factor for tailoring the adsorption/desorption
transition and interfacial structure of the polyelectrolyte/monolayer
complex.},
