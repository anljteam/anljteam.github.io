 abstract = {Using Monte Carlo simulation techniques, we focus on the physical
gelation behavior and conformation change under the existence of
additional monovalent salt, which provides screening to the
electrostatic interaction of charged telechelic polyelectrolyte chains
and causes new balance between hydrophobic interaction. of end groups
and electrostatic interaction originated from the polyelectrolyte
blocks. For the electrostatic interaction dominated system, the
screening effects will decrease the electrostatic repulsion between
small sized clusters and enable the further aggregation of TP chains,
resulting in prompting the sol-gel transition progress; for the
short-range attraction dominated system, the screening effects present a
complicated phenomenon, which includes the prompting effect at the
beginning of sol-gel and a hindering effect when the gelation progress
is close to an end.},
