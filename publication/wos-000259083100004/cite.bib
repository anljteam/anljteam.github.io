 abstract = {Objective To seek a rapid and reliable molecular biology method to
identify the common pathogenic dermatophyte fungi from clinical samples.
Method The genome DNA was extracted from cultured strains of seven
common dermatophyte fungi species and part of each positive clinical
specimen by microscopy. Intergenic spacer regions of ribosomal DNA (ITS)
were amplified by semi-nested PCR (snPCR) with three universal primers
(NS5, ITS1, and ITS4) for fungi. The amplified products were digested
with two restriction endonucleases (BciT130 I, Dde I), the Restriction
Fragment Length Polymorphism(RFLP). The rest of each clinical specimen
was cultured in Sabouraud's Agar medium. Then the results of RFLP were
compared with the traditional culture results.
Results The digestion of seven common dermatophyte fungi produced seven
different restriction profiles. Restriction profiles of 17 clinical
specimens matched, respectively, to that of the cultured strains, and 14
profiles of the 17 ones matched the culture result completely. The
coincidence was 100.0%.
Conclusions snPCR-RFLP analysis of intergenic spacer regions of
ribosomal DNA is a valuable method of exactness and clarity for species
identification of common dermatophyte fungi from clinical specimens.},
