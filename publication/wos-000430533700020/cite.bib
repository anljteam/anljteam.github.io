 abstract = {Eosinophils are typically associated with unique inflammatory settings,
including allergic inflammation and helminth infections. However, new
information suggests that eosinophils contribute more broadly to
inflammatory responses and participate in local immune regulation and
the tissue remodeling/repair events linked with a variety of diseases.
Eosinophilic infiltration has long been a histologic hallmark of bullous
pemphigoid (BP), a subepidermal autoimmune blistering disease
characterized by autoantibodies directed against basement membrane
protein BP180. However, the exact role of eosinophils in disease
pathogenesis remains largely unknown. We show here that eosinophils are
necessary for IgE autoantibody-mediated BP blister formation in a
humanized IgE receptor mouse model of BP. Disease severity is IgE dose
dependent and correlates with the degree of eosinophil infiltration in
the skin. Furthermore, IgE autoantibodies fail to induce BP in
eosinophil-deficient mice, confirming that eosinophils are required for
IgE-mediated tissue injury. Thus, eosinophils provide the cellular link
between IgE autoantibodies and skin blistering in this murine model of
BP. These findings suggest a role for eosinophils in autoimmune disease
and have important implications for the treatment of BP and other
antibody-mediated inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.},
