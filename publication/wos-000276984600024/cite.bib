 abstract = {The efficient procedure for preparation of azo-based chitosan biopolymer
using chitosan and 2-(4-dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoic acid (methyl red)
in isopropyl alcohol under mild condition has been demonstrated. After
the reaction, the product was successively washed with an isopropyl
alcohol and water mixture (5:1, v/v) and dried in air. Finally, the
obtained product was confirmed and characterized by UV-Vis, FTIR, H-1
NMR spectroscopy and XRD. The thermal, surface morphology and optical
properties were evaluated by TGA, DSC, SEM, AFM, photoluminescence (PL)
spectroscopy and second harmonic generation (SHG) studies. The maximum
molar absorption coefficient (epsilon(max)), and correlation coefficient
(r) were -0.0112 L mol(-1) cm(-1) and 0.998. Absorption of the
derivative was high (10(4) cm(-1)) with optical band gap of 2.37 eV. The
azo-based chitosan derivative may be considered as a novel optical
material from biomedical application point of views. (c) 2009 Elsevier
