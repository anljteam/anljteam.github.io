 abstract = {In protein-polysaccharide complex systems, how nonspecific interactions
such as electrostatic and van der Waals interactions affect complex
formation has not been clearly understood. On the basis of a
coarse-grained model with the specificity of a target system, we have
applied Monte Carlo (MC) simulation to illustrate the process of complex
coacervate formation from the association of proteins and
polysaccharides. The coarse-grained model is based on serum albumin and
a polycation system, and the MC simulation of pH impact on complex
coacervation has been carried out. We found that complex coacervates
could form three ways, but the conventional association through
electrostatic attraction between the protein and polysaccharide still
dominated the complex coacervation in such systems. We also observed
that the depletion potential always participated in protein crowding and
was weakened in the presence of strong electrostatic interactions.
Furthermore, we observed that the sizes of polysaccharide chains
nonmonotonically increased with the number of bound proteins. Our
approach provides a new way to understand the details during
protein-polysaccharide complex coacervation at multiple length scales,
from interaction and conformation to aggregation.},
