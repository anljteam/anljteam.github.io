 abstract = {Egy1 was isolated as an ethylene-dependent gravitropism-deficient
Arabidopsis mutant. Molecular studies reveal that EGY1 gene encodes a
59-kDa plastid-targeted metalloprotease. It is actively expressed in
hypocotyl tissue and targets to endodermal and cortex plastid. Its
protein level is up-regulated by both ethylene and light. CAB protein
accumulation and chlorophyll level is severely reduced in hypocotyls and
endodermal cells, respectively. Sucrose is able to restore the severely
reduced starch and lipid contents as well as the deficient endodermal
plastid size found in light-grown egy1 hypocotyls yet it fails to rescue
the reduced plastid number and chlorophyll level in egy1 endodermal
cells. The loss-of-function egy1 mutation results in a smaller size (1.9
+/- 0.3 mu m in diameter) and less number (5 +/- 1) of plastids in
endodermal cells, which are nearly 50% of the wild-type. EGY1 is
specially required for the development of full-size endodermal plastid
in seedlings that are grown on sucrose-free media under light. It plays
a direct role in controlling the light-induced chlorophyll production,
grana formation and plastid replication in endodermal cell. However, it
plays an indirect role in regulation of endodermal plastid size. It is
likely that the ethylene-dependent gravitropism-deficient phenotype of
egy1 hypocotyls may result from the smaller size and less number of
endodermal plastids. Gravicurvature assays performed on
ethylene-insensitive mutants, etr1-1, etr2-1, ers2-1, ein4-1 and ein2-5,
have clearly demonstrated the necessary role for ethylene in vigorous
gravitropism of light-grown hypocotyls. The degree of ethylene-dependent
gravicurvature is positively correlated with the combined state of
endodermal plastid mass and number. Neither ethylene nor EGY1-regulated
full-size endodermal plastid is sufficient for promotion of vigorous
hypocotyl gravitropism. Presence of 4 full-size plastids per endodermal
cell together with ethylene pretreatment of hypocotyls becomes
sufficient to trigger vigorous gravicurvature in light-grown seedlings.
A model is therefore proposed to address the role of EGY1 in regulation
of endodermal plastid size and number as well as the stimulatory effect
of ethylene on hypocotyl gravitropism.},
