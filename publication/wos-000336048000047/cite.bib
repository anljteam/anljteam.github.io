 abstract = {The properties of both untangled and entangled linear polymer melts
under shear flow are studied by nonequilibrium molecular dynamics
simulations. The results reveal that the dependence of shear viscosity
eta on shear rate (gamma) over dot, expressed by eta similar to (gamma)
over dot(-n), exhibits three distinct regimes. The first is the
well-known Newtonian regime, namely, eta independent of shear rate at
small shear rates (gamma) over dot < tau(-1)(0) (where tau(0) is the
longest polymer relaxation time at equilibrium). In the non-Newtonian
regime ((gamma) over dot > tau(-1)(0)), the shear dependence of
viscosity exhibits a crossover at a critical shear rate (gamma) over
dot(c) dividing this regime into two different regimes, shear thinning
regime I (ST-I) and II (ST-II), respectively. In the ST-I regime
(tau(-1)(0) < (gamma) over dot < (gamma) over dot(c)), the exponent eta
increases with increasing chain length N, while in the ST-II regime
((gamma) over dot > (gamma) over dot(c)) a universal power law eta
similar to (gamma) over dot(-0.37) is found for considered chain
lengths. Furthermore, the longer the polymer chain is, the smaller the
shear viscosity for a given shear rate in the ST-II regime. The
simulation also shows that a characteristic chain length, below which
(gamma) over dot(c) will be equal to tau(-1)(0), lies in the interval 30
< N < 50. For all considered chain lengths in the ST-II regime, we also
find that the first and second normal stress differences N-1 and N-2
follow power laws of N-1 similar to (gamma) over dot(2/3) and N-2
similar to (gamma) over dot(0.82), respectively; the orientation
resistance parameter m(G) follows the relation m(G) similar to (gamma)
over dot(0.75) and the tumbling frequency f(tb) similar to follows f(tb)
similar to (gamma) over dot(0.75). These results imply that the effects
of entanglement on the shear dependences of these properties may be
negligible in the ST-II regime. These findings may shed some light on
the nature of shear thinning in flexible linear polymer melts. (C) 2014
