 abstract = {In this work, we have carried out Brownian dynamics simulation to
describe the detailed characteristics of conformational and rheological
responses to startup shear. In addition to the evaluation of the contour
length of the primitive chain, the state of chain entanglement and the
first normal stress difference as a function of strain, three methods
are applied to determine the time-dependent shear stress. Our results
show significant stretching of the primitive chain up to many Rouse
times, followed by retraction, as the primary origin of stress overshoot
for deformation rates lower than the reciprocal of the Rouse time but
higher than the reciprocal of the reptation time. The analysis of such
results reveals heterogeneous local chain stretching, demonstrating the
coupling between stretching and orientation that extends to times
considerably longer than the Rouse time. Explicit comparison between the
simulation and the theoretical description from the GLaMM theory shows
marked differences. For example, the simulation indicates a slower
decline in the number of original entanglements than that at equilibrium
up to many Rouse times whereas the GLaMM theory predicts a faster
decrease. Moreover, contrary to the simulation that depicts a nearly
constant slope in the stress strain relationship during startup shear,
the GLaMM theory shows an immediate and precipitous strain softening.},
