 abstract = {Two kinds of dewetting and their transition induced by composition
fluctuation due to different composition in blend [poly(methyl
methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(styrene-ran-acrylonitrile) (SAN)] films on
SiOx substrate at 145 degrees C have been studied by in-situ atomic
force microscopy (AFM). The results showed that morphology and pathway
of dewetting depended crucially on the composition. Possible reason is
the variation in intensity of composition fluctuation resulted from the
change of components in polymer blend. Based on the discussion of this
fluctuation due to the composition gradient, parameter of U-q0/E, which
describes the initial amplitude of the surface undulation and original
thickness of film respectively, has been employed to distinguish the
morphologies of spontaneous dewetting including bicontinuous structures
and holes. Prior to the investigation of dewetting, it is confirmed that
this blend is miscible at 145 degrees C using grazing incidence ultra
small-angle X-ray scattering (GIUSAX). (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights
