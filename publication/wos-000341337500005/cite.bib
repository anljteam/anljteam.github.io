 abstract = {Replica exchange Monte Carlo simulation equipped with an
orientation-enhanced hydrophobic interaction was utilized to study the
impacts of molar ratio and ionic strength on the complex formation of
human serum albumin (HSA) and catechin. Only a small amount of catechins
was found to act as bridges in the formation of HSA catechin complexes.
Selective binding behavior was observed at low catechin to HSA molar
ratio (R). Increase of catechin amount can suppress HSA self-aggregation
and diminish the selectivity of protein binding sites. Strong saturation
binding with short-range interactions was found to level off at around
4.6 catechins per HSA on average, while this number slowly increased
with R when long-range interactions were taken into account. Meanwhile,
among the three rings of catechin, the 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl (B-ring)
shows the strongest preference to bind HSA. Neither the aggregation nor
the binding sites of the HSA catechin complex was sensitive to ionic
strength, suggesting that the electrostatic interaction is not a
dominant force in such complexes. These results provide a further
molecular level understanding of protein-polyphenol binding, and the
strategy employed in this work shows a way to bridge phase behaviors at
macroscale and the distribution of binding sites at residue level.},
