 abstract = {The micrographs of epoxy resin on single carbon fiber at room
temperature and the temperature dependent contact angle on single carbon
fiber were investigated using field environmental scanning electron
microscope (FESEM). The results showed that the contact angle decreases
significantly with increasing temperature. The advantage of this
experimental approach was that can directly reflected the wettability of
epoxy resin to fiber. But the experimental process was complicated, and
there were many influence factors. The reason is that the wettability of
epoxy resin on parallel sheet can be improved at higher temperatures.
The spreading procedures for the epoxy resin droplet on carbon fiber
cluster were observed by means of drop shape analysis system ( DSA) in
parallel and perpendicular directions of the aligned fibers. It was
found that the temperature dependent contact angles were quite distinct
from the different observed directions. Moreover, the contact angles
observed perpendicular to the direction of fibers are consistent with
the results on the single carbon fiber, which indicates that the wetting
behavior of epoxy resin to the fiber in the direction parallel to the
fiber cluster can truly represent the wettability. Then, the complicated
method about single fiber of using FESEM to understand the wettability
of epoxy resin to fiber could be replaced by using DSA. It should save
much time and energy for the practical industry.},
