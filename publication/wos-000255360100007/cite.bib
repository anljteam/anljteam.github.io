 abstract = {Nearly monodisperse Cu-In-S ternary nanocrystals with tunable
composition, crystalline structure, and size were synthesized by a
hot-injection method using mixed generic precursors. Such ternary
nanocrystals with zincblende and wurtzite structure were reported for
the first time. This work correlates the crystalline structure of the
binary ZnS nanoparticles with those of ternary Cu-In-S nanocrystals,
demonstrating the feasibility of making their alloyed or core/shell
structure. Furthermore, this work may provide suitable material
candidates for low-cost, high-efficiency solar cell fabrication.},
