 abstract = {The final structure of molten syndiotactic polypropylene (sPP) sheared
under different conditions was investigated by synchrotron small-angle
x-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide-angle x-ray diffraction (WAXD)
techniques to elucidate the shear effects on sPP crystalline structure.
The results obtained from the WAXD show that there is no variation on
crystalline form but a little difference on the orientation of the 200
reflection. The SAXS data indicate that the lamellar thickness and long
period have not been affected by shear but the lamellar orientation is
dependent on shear. The experimental data of sPP crystallization from
sheared melt may indicate a mesophase structure that is crucial to the
shear effects on the final polymer multiscale crystalline structures.
