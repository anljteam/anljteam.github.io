 abstract = {In the reactive extrusion process for polymerization, the chemical
calorific effect has a great influence on the temperature. In order to
quantitatively analyze the polymerization trend and optimize the
processing conditions, the phenomena of the chemical calorific effect
during reactive extrusion processes for free radical polymerization were
analyzed. Numerical computation expressions of the heat of chemical
reaction and the reactive calorific intensity were deduced, and then a
numerical simulation of the reactive extrusion process for the
polymerization of n-butyl methacrylate was carried out. The evolutions
of the heat of chemical reaction and the reactive calorific intensity
along the! axial direction of the extruder are presented, on the basis
of which reactive processing conditions can be optimized. (C) 2007
