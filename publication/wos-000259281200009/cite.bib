 abstract = {We have developed a novel strategy for the preparation of ion-bonded
supramolecular star polymers by RAFT polymerization. An ion-bonded star
supramolecule with six functional groups was prepared from a
triphenylene derivative containing tertiary amino groups and
trithiocarbonate carboxylic acid, and used as the RAFT agent in
polymerizations of tert-butyl acrylate (tBA) and styrene (St). Molecular
weights and structures of the polymers were characterized by (1)H NMR
and GPC. The results show that the polymerization possesses the
character of living free-radical polymerization and the ion-bonded
supramolecular star polymers PSt, PtBA, and PSt-b-PtBA, with six
well-defined arms, were successfully synthesized.},
