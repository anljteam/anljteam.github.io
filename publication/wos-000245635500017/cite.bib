 abstract = {Colloidal CdSe and CdS quantum dots were synthesized at low temperatures
(60-90 degrees C) by a two-phase approach at a toluene-water interface.
Oil-soluble cadmium myristate (Cd-MA) was used as cadmium source, and
water-soluble Na2S, thiourea, NaHSe, Na2SeSO3, and selenourea were used
as sulfur and selenium sources, respectively. When a cadmium precursor
in toluene and a selenium precursor in water were mixed, CdSe
nanocrystals were achieved at a toluene-water interface in the range of
1.2-3.2 nm in diameter. Moreover, we also synthesized highly luminescent
CdSe/CdS core-shell quantum dots by a two-phase approach using poorly
reactive thiourea as sulfur source in an autoclave at 140 degrees C or
under normal pressure at 90 degrees C. Colloidal solutions of CdSe/CdS
core-shell nanocrystals exhibit a photoluminescence quantum yield (PL
QY) up to 42% relative to coumarin 6 at room temperature.},
