 abstract = {In order to physically elucidates the anomalous intrinsic viscosity of
dendrimers, first, the radial segmental density profile of dendrimers is
calculated by the self-consistent mean field method. Secondly, based on
the two-zone model proposed, the intrinsic viscosity as a function of
generation of dendrimers with the following parameters, including the
number of generations, the functionality of the core, the length of
spacer, the effective coefficient of correlation and the excluded volume
is systematically investigated. Thirdly, the origin of dendrimers'
anomalous intrinsic viscosity is elucidated in the microscopic scale,
namely the competition of the number fraction between the two kinds of
monomers without the capability of dragging solvent, which is caused by
the increase of volume of the core and the back-folding ability caused
by entropy effect. Finally, it is physically elucidated that the nature
of the intrinsic viscosity is the reflection of the ability per monomer
of dendrimer to averagely drag solvent molecules alone rather than the
reflection of the degree of polymerization. This research will be
benefit for the optimum design of dendrimer materials in the
corresponding application areas.},
