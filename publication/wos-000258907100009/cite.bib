 abstract = {The in situ crystallization kinetics of syndiotactic poly(propylene)
(sPP) has been investigated by synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS). The structure evolutions during the isothermal crystallization
of sPP with different shear rates have been observed. The results show
that shear accelerates the process of crystallization kinetics. Even
under low shear rate, the lamellae can be distinctly oriented. In
contrast, the lamellar parameters such as the long period, lamellar
thickness, and the scattering invariant 0 can change obviously only
under high shear rate. A mesomorphic structure proposed by Strobl is
adopted to elucidate the differences of shear effects with low and high
shear rates. Based on all the analysis we are convinced that a
relatively stable mesomorphic structure forms before shear is composed
and the shear effects on the mesophase will be retained to a certain
extent until crystallization is finished.},
