 abstract = {How polymers with different architectures respond to shear stress is a
key issue to develop a fundamental understanding of their dynamical
behaviors. We investigate the conformation, orientation, dynamics, and
rheology of individual star polymers in a simple shear flow by
multiparticle collision dynamics integrated with molecular dynamics
simulations. Our studies reveal that star polymers present a linear
transformation from tumbling to tank-treading-like motions as the number
of arms increases. In the transformation region, the flow-induced
deformation, orientation, frequency of motions, and rheological
properties show universal scaling relationships against the reduced
Weissenberg number, independent of the number and the length of arms.
Further, we make a comprehensive comparison on the flow-induced
behaviors between linear, ring, and star polymers. The results indicate
that distinct from linear polymers, star and ring polymers present
weaker deformation, orientation change, and shear thinning, either
contributed by a dense center or without ends.},
