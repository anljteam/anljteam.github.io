 abstract = {A new flow field was designed to search flow fields fitting polymer
electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) better due its extensible.
There are many independent inlets and outlets in the new flow field. The
new flow field we named NINO can extend to be more general when
pressures at the inlet and outlet vary and some usual flow fields will
be obtained. A new mathematical model whose view angle is obverse is
used to describe the flow field. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights
