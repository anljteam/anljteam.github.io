 abstract = {The xantho-oligosaccharides with different ratio of the viscosity to the
reducing sugar were produced from xanthan by Cellulomonas sp. LX. It was
found that the cell growth of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris
could be inhibited by some types of the xantho-oligosaccharides and the
significant inhibitory activity was observed when S4 and S5 were tested,
in which the values of the viscosity/reducing sugar were 232.5 and
101.4, respectively. The xantho-oligosaccharides not only inhibited the
growth of X. campestris pv. campestris but also reduced the production
of xanthan which is the virulence of X. campestris pv. campestris. The
production of the extracellular enzymes released from X. campestris pv.
campestris including cellulase, chitinase, pectinase and proteinase also
were partially inhibited. The study indicated the potential application
of the xantho-oligosaccharides in the management of diseases caused by
X. campestris pv. campestris in several important crop plants. (c) 2006
