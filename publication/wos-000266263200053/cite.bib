 abstract = {We investigate the dewetting behavior of the bilayer of
air/PS/PMMA/silanized Si wafer and find the two competing dewetting
pathways in the dewetting process. The upper layer dewets on the lower
layer (dewetting pathway 1, the liquid-liquid dewetting) and the two
layers rupture on the solid substrate (dewetting pathway 2, the
liquid-solid dewetting). To the two competing dewetting pathways, the
process of forming holes and the process of hole growth, influence their
competing relation. In the process of forming holes, the time of forming
holes is a main factor that influences their competing relation. During
the process of hole growth, the dewetting velocity is a main factor that
influences their competing relation. The liquid-liquid interfacial
tension, the film thickness of the polymer, and the viscosity of the
polymer are important factors that influence the time of forming holes
and the dewetting velocity. When the liquid-liquid dewetting pathway and
the liquid-solid dewetting pathway compete in the dewetting process, the
competing relation can be controlled by changing the molecular weight of
the polymer, the film thickness, and the annealing temperature. In
addition, it is also found that the rim growth on the solid substrate is
by a rolling mechanism in the process of hole growth.},
