 abstract = {It is well known that glass-forming liquids exhibit a number of
anomalous dynamical phenomena, most notably a two-step relaxation in the
self-intermediate scattering function and the breakdown of the
Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation, as they are cooled toward the glass
transition temperature. While these phenomena are generally ascribed to
dynamic heterogeneity, specifically to the presence of slow- and
fast-moving particles, a quantitative elucidation of the two-step
relaxation and the violation of the SE relation in terms of these
concepts has not been successful. In this work, we propose a
classification of particles according to the rank order of their
displacements (from an arbitrarily defined origin of time), and we
divide the particles into long-distance (LD), medium-distance, and
short-distance (SD) traveling particle groups. Using molecular-dynamics
simulation data of the Kob-Andersen model, we show quantitatively that
the LD group is responsible for the fast relaxation in the two-step
relaxation process in the intermediate scattering function, while the SD
group gives rise to the slow (alpha) relaxation. Furthermore, our
analysis reveals that tau(alpha) is controlled by the SD group, while
the ensemble-averaged diffusion coefficient D is controlled by both the
LD and SD groups. The combination of these two features provides a
natural explanation for the breakdown in the SE relation at low
temperature. In addition, we find that the alpha-relaxation time,
tau(alpha), of the overall system is related to the relaxation time of
the LD particles, tau(LD), as tau(alpha) = tau(0) exp(Omega
tau(LD)/k(B)T).},
