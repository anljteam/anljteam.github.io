 abstract = {The crystal structure of thin pi-conjugated polymer films is critical to
their performance. Here, we utilized regio-regular poly
(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) films as a model system with grazing
incident X-ray diffraction (GIXD) characterization. We systematically
studied the effects of solvent polarity on the control of the crystal
structure of thin pi-conjugated polymer films in mixed solvent
immersion. The polarity of poor solvents plays an important role in the
crystallization behavior of the films, and the polarity of good solvents
slightly influences the crystallization behavior of the thin P3HT films.
Non-polar poor solvents increase the crystallinity of thin pi-conjugated
P3HT films by producing new crystalline nuclei in the thin polymer
films; however, polar poor solvents can improve crystallinity via
crystal growth. The results of this work offer a better understanding of
the crystallization behavior of thin pi-conjugated polymer films induced
by liquid mixtures. The results offer important insight into solvent
immersion control technologies.},
