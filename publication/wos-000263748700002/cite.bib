 abstract = {Nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker, has been used mainly in the
therapy of cardiovascular diseases. Recently, its indications have been
extended experimentally to a wider range of disorders especially some
central nervous system (CNS) disorders. In this study, we investigated
whether nimodipine is neuroprotective to inflammation-mediated
neurodegenerative diseases. Pretreatment with nimodipine reduced the
degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons induced by LPS in
mesencephalic neuron-glia cultures in a dose-dependent manner. The
neuroprotective effect of nimodipine was attributed to the inhibition of
microglial activation, since nimodipine significantly inhibited the
production of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and prostaglandin E-2
(PGE(2)) from LPS-stimulated microglia. Moreover, nimodipine was not
neuroprotective to 1-methyi-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-induced DA
neurotoxicity in the absence of microglia. Mechanistic study showed that
nimodipine failed to protect the degeneration of neurons in neuron-glia
cultures from mice lacking functional NADPH oxidase (PHOX), a key enzyme
for extracellular superoxide production in immune cells. Taken together
these results suggest that nimodipine is protective to DA
neurodegeneration via inhibiting the microglial-mediated oxidative
stress and inflammatory response. Thus, nimodipine may be a potential
therapeutic agent for the treatment of inflammation-related
neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. (C) 2008
