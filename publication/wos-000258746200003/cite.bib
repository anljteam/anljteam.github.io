 abstract = {The uniaxial tension experiments on glass-fiber-reinforced epoxy matrix
composites reveal that the fragmentations of fibers display vertically
aligned fracture, clustered fracture, coordinated fracture, and random
fracture with the increase of inter-fiber spacing. The finite element
analysis indicates that the fragmentations of fibers displaying
different phenomena are due to the stress concentration as well as the
inherent randomness of fiber defects, which is the dominant factor. The
experimental results show that matrices adjacent to the fiber
breakpoints all exhibit birefringent-whitening patterns for the
composites with different interfacial adhesion strengths. The larger the
extent of the interfacial debonding, the less the domain of the
birefringent-whitening patterns. The numerical analysis indicates that
the orientation of the matrix adjacent to a fiber breakpoint is caused
by the interfacial shear stress, resulting in the birefringent-whitening
patterns. The area of shear stress concentrations decides on the domain
of the birefringent-whitening patterns.},
