 abstract = {We study the interactions between a cationic polypeptide chain with
tunable hydrophobicity and a fluid phosphatidyl-choline lipid monolayer
composed of neutral, tetravalent phosphatidylinositol 4, 5bisphosphate
and univalent phosphatidylserine acidic lipids at various ionic
concentrations of the salt solution, using a simple coarse-grained Monte
Carlo model. Our work illustrates that the enhancement in the
polypeptide hydrophobicity strengthens the short-range attractions
between monomers, which elevates the electrostatic energy gain of the
polypeptide/membrane complexity, but enlarges the conformational entropy
loss of the shrunken polypeptide and demixing entropy loss of the
segregated acidic lipids. These energy-entropy competitions result in
qualitatively different dependences of anchoring/dissociation transition
critical ionic concentration on hydrophobic monomer-monomer energy
parameter eh for polypeptides with short and long chain lengths. In the
anchoring region, we show that changing the polypeptide hydrophobicity
leads to diverse chain conformations at various ionic concentrations for
polypeptides with both short and long chain lengths. Furthermore, we
illustrate the nontrivial feature of the reorganization of the acidic
lipids underneath the anchored polypeptides. Our work demonstrates that
the chain conformations of the anchored polypeptides with different
hydrophobicities can be a key factor influencing the amounts and
concentration gradients of the segregated acidic lipids. These findings
suggest that polypeptide hydrophobicity provides an efficient molecular
factor for tailoring the anchoring/association transition and
interfacial structures of the polypeptide/membrane complexities, thereby
offering insight into the innovation of new biotechnologies based on the
functional switch of the anchored biopolymers and the regulation of
messenger lipids. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
