 abstract = {In resin transfer molding processes, the edge effect caused by the
nonuniformity of permeability between fiber preform and edge channel may
disrupt resin flow patterns and often results in the incomplete wetting
of fiber preform, the formation of dry spots, and other defects in final
composite materials. So a numerical simulation algorithm is developed to
analyze the complex mold-filling process with edge effect. The newly
modified governing equations involving the effect of mold cavity
thickness on flow patterns and the volume-averaging momentum equations
containing viscous and inertia terms are adopted to describe the fluid
flow in the edge area and in the fiber preform, respectively. The volume
of fluid (VOF) method is applied to tracking the free interface between
the two types of fluids, namely the resin and the air. Under constant
pressure injection conditions, the effects of transverse permeability,
edge channel width, and mold cavity thickness on flow patterns are
analyzed. The results demonstrate that the transverse flow is not only
affected by the transverse permeability and the edge channel width but
also by the mold cavity thickness. The simulated results are in
agreement with the experimental results. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals,
