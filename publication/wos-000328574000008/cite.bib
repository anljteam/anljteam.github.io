 abstract = {The application of nanofiltration in industrial fields is increasing
rapidly in recent years, especially in drinking water treatment.
Nevertheless, the mechanism of mass transport through these membranes
has not yet been fully understood. And the optimal design of
nanofiltration processes still faces challenges. At first, the Donnan
Steric Pore Model (DSPM) is described in this paper, which is
constructed on the basis of the extended Nernst-Planck equation for the
prediction of the nanofiltration process of polymeric membrane. Then the
DSPM model is used to characterize three kinds of membranes (AFC40, CA30
and NTR7450) for the nanofiltration of 50 mol/m(3) NaCl solution and
NTR7450 membrane for the nanofiltration of NaCl and MgSO4 solution with
different concentrations. The simulated results and their comparison
with experimental results show that the DSPM model can effectively
predict the membrane performance. And then a description of the Pores
and Polarization Transport Model (PPTM) is presented, which is developed
on the basis of the DSPM model, in order for characterizing cross-flow
nanofiltration. The PPTM model combines the
convection-diffusion-migration transport in the nanopores with the
transport through the concentration polarization layer. To improve the
PPTM model in the aspect of using an empirical model to describe the
velocity field of solution above the membrane, the velocity profile in
solution is solved by Navier-Stokes equation and continuity equation in
this paper. The cross-flow nanofiltration of polymeric membrane is
simulated using the finite element method, by coupling mass transfer in
the membrane with ion concentration and velocity profile in solution
above the membrane. By the comparison with experimental results and
traditional PPTM results, it can be found that the modified method can
reflect the change tendencies of ion concentration and velocity profile
in solution, and their values are more in line with the values of
experiments. The improved model can provide more reliable theoretical
basis for the optimal design of cross-flow nanofiltration processes of
polymeric membrane.},
