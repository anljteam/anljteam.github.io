 abstract = {A new thermophilic inulinase-producing strain, which grows optimally at
60 degrees C, was isolated from soil samples with medium containing
inulin as a sole carbon source. It was identified as a Bacillus smithii
by analysis of 16s rDNA. Maximum inulinase yield of 135.2 IU/ml was
achieved with medium pH7.0, containing inulin 2.0%, (NH4)H2PO4 0.5%,
yeast extract 0.5%, at 50 degrees C 200 rpm shaker for 72-h incubation.
The purified inulinase from the extracellular extract of B. smithii T7
shows endoinulinolytic activity. The optimum pH for this endoinulinase
is 4.5 and stable at pH range of 4.0-8.0. The optimum temperature for
enzyme activity was 70 degrees C, the half life of the endoinulinase is
9 h and 2.5 h at 70 degrees C and 80 degrees C respectively.
Comparatively lower Michaelis-Menten constant (4.17 mM) and higher
maximum reaction velocity (833 IU/mg protein) demonstrate the
endoinulinase's greater affinity for inulin substrate. These findings
are significant for its potential industrial application.},
