 abstract = {The crystalline structure evolution of poly(butylene
terephthalate)/poly(carbonate) (PBT/PC) during stretching was
investigated by in situ synchrotron wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS)
and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) at 70 degrees C. The WAXS
results demonstrated that the crystallinity and crystallite size (D-100)
decrease with deformation. The alpha-beta transition was observed during
the deformation of PBT/PC blends. The orientation degree of the PBT
(100) diffraction increases with strain in the PBT/PC blends. The SAXS
data showed that PC is located in the interlamellar region of PBT for
the undeformed samples. A structure model was proposed to describe the
stretching-induced structure evolution of the PBT/PC blends.},
