 abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus contains a heat-stable phytase of great potential.
To determine whether this phytase could be expressed in plants as a
functional enzyme, we introduced the phytase gene from A. fumigatus
(fphyA) in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. NC89) by
Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Phytase expression was controlled
by the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. Secretion of
recombinant phytase (tfphyA) to the extracellular fluid was established
by use of the signal sequence from tobacco calreticulin. Forty-one
independent transgenic plants were generated. Single-copy line A was
selected based on segregation of T-1 seeds for kanamycin resistance,
phytase expression and Southern blotting analysis for use in further
study. After 4-weeks of plant growth, the phytase was accumulated in
leaves up to 2.3% of total soluble protein. tfphyA was functional and
shared similar profiles of pH, temperature and thermal stability to the
same enzyme expressed in Pichia pastoris (pfphyA). The expressed enzyme
had an apparent molecular rnass of 63 kDa and showed maximum activity at
pH 5.5, and temperature, 55 degrees C. It had a high thermostability and
retained 28.7% of the initial activity even after incubation at 90
degrees C for 15 min. The above results showed that the thermostable A.
fumigatus phytase could be expressed in tobacco as a functional enzyme
and thus has the potential of overexpressing it in other crop plants
also.},
