 abstract = {The diffusion behavior of polyelectrolytes in dilute salt-free solution
is studied through a hybrid mesoscale simulation technique that combines
the molecular dynamics method and the multiparticle collision dynamics
approach. To elucidate the effects of hydrodynamic interactions (HI), we
compare results for hydrodynamic and random solvents. When HI are taken
into account, we find that the chain diffusivity decreases initially and
then increases gradually with the increasing strength of the Coulomb
interaction. By contrast, when HI are switched off, the
electrostatic-dependent diffusivity shows three distinct regions, and a
plateau of approximately constant diffusivity manifests between two
decreasing regions. The findings reveal that the dynamics of
polyelectrolytes in dilute solution depend on the coupling effects of
hydrodynamic and Coulomb interactions, and that these dynamics can be
understood by considering the conformational changes of chains, the
counterion condensation, and the dynamics of counterions.},
