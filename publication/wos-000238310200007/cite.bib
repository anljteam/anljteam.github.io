 abstract = {An attempt was made to identify the genotypes of 31 Sporothrix schenckii
strains and the relationship between the genotypes, the geographic
distributions and clinical manifestations using restriction fragment
length polymorphic analysis. The total DNA was extracted by
cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide. The polymorphisms were detected by
hybridisation of ApaI-digested Sporothrix genomic DNA with a probe
amplified from the small subunit ribosomal DNA and adjacent internal
transcribed spacer regions. The band patterns manifested by Southern
blotting were explored to investigate the genotypes of the 31 strains of
S. schenckii collected from five different areas in China. Of the data
from the 31 strains of S. schenckii studied, 15 individual patterns (DNA
type A-O) were recognised. Type A-C accounted for 51.61% of all the
strains. The DNA typing of S. schenckii by Southern blotting was highly
sensitive and highly distinguishable. We also found a significant
correlation between DNA patterns and different geographic areas and
clinical manifestations.},
