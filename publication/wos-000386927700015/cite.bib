 abstract = {We develop a coarse-grained Monte Carlo model for the anchoring of
cationic polymers onto a phosphatidyl-choline (PC) lipid monolayer,
doped with univalent phosphatidylserine (PS) and tetravalent
phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2) anionic lipids. Using this
model, we extensively explore the effects of important factors on the
structural alterations of the polymers/monolayer complex, including the
polymer concentration, the polymer ionization fraction and the ionic
concentration of the salt solution. We find the substantial disparity in
the scaling of the anchoring/dissociation transition for
polymers/monolayer complex and polyelectrolyte/surface system, which
demonstrates that the mobile anionic monolayer exerts stronger
attraction on cationic polymers than uniformly charged surface, thereby
illustrating the significant predominance of PIP2 lipids in the
anchoring procedure. In the polymer anchoring regime, increasing the
polymer ionization fraction drastically strengthens the attractions
between polymers and the monolayer at low polymer concentrations, which
in turn results in the transformation of individual polymer chains from
a brush-like structure to a pancake-like structure and leads to the
enhancement of PIP2 sequestration. Elevating the polymer concentration
strengthens the competition of the anchoring between individual
polymers, and the fraction of anchored polymers can even saturate at
sufficiently high polymer concentrations. At high polymer
concentrations, this competition forces both weakly and strongly charged
polymers to anchor onto the membrane in the brush-like conformation,
thereby sequestering smaller PIP2 clusters. The PS lipids cluster around
the polymer/PIP2 complexes when the amount of tetravalent PIP2 lipids is
insufficient to neutralize the anchored cationic polymers. We also
observe that the monolayer can be overcharged due to the anchoring of
polymers at high polymer concentrations. Our work thus approaches an
improved understanding of the anchoring processes from a fundamental
perspective based on the estimates of the stability and the structural
variations of the polymers/monolayer complex with important molecular
factors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
