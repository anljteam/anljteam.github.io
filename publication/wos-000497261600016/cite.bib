 abstract = {The static and dynamic behaviors of linear and ring polymers under shear
flow over a wide range of shear rates are studied using a hybrid
simulation method that couples multiple-particle collision dynamics with
molecular dynamics. The results reveal that the polymer size increases
monotonically with increasing shear rate when hydrodynamic interactions
are ignored, in agreement with classic theoretical predictions. However,
for the cases with hydrodynamic interactions, due to the transition from
a linear to a nonlinear velocity profile, the size of both linear and
ring chains exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence on the shear rate, and
this counterintuitive behavior could be divided into three main regimes.
At specific shear rates, linear polymers exhibit a relatively stable
stretched state and a rapidly rotating collapsed state, which correspond
to the maximum and minimum sizes, respectively. Although the rings
behave similarly to the linear polymers, there exist two different
relatively stable stretched states: one with an oval-shaped conformation
and the other with an S-shaped conformation. For the oval-shaped state,
the tumbling motion almost disappears but the tank-treading motion
persists, whereas for the S-shaped state, both tumbling and
tank-treading motions are greatly suppressed. Moreover, contrary to
previous theoretical predictions, a noticeable bulge is observed for the
polymer size in the gradient direction and the alignment angle deviates
considerably from theoretical prediction, indicating the existence of
relatively stable collapsed conformations at large shear rates for both
linear and ring polymers. However, in ideal linear shear flow introduced
by using the ``fix deformâ€³ command to Dissipative Particle Dynamics
system in LAMMPS package, both linear and ring polymers exhibit a
monotonic dependence of size on shear rate. These results shed new light
on the understanding of the dynamic response of linear and ring polymers
in ultrahigh shear flows.},
