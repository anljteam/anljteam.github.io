 abstract = {The coagulant effects of phospholipase A(2) with Gln at 49 sites
(Gln49-PLA(2)), purified from Gloydius ussurensis snake venom, were
investigated on human citrated plasma and fibrinogen. Gln49-PLA2 clotted
human plasma dose-dependently from 180.67 +/- 1.86s to 19.00 +/- 0.58s,
and reduced the re-calcification time from 7.46 +/- 1.17 to 0.75 +/-
0.33 min and the prothrombin time from 12.4 +/- 0.29 s to 6.95 +/- 0.20
s, but it could not activate factor XIII, and the procoagulant effects
were inhibited by heparin. The specific clotting activities of
Gln49-PLA2 were equivalent to 1100 NIH thrombin U/mg on human
fibrinogen, and the specific arginine esterase activity on the substrate
BAEE was 1747 U/mg. Gln49-PLA2 hydrolyzed fibrinopeptide A faster than
fibrinopeptide B, and the fibrinongenolytic ability was inhibited by the
serine protease inhibitor phenyl-methylsulphony fluoride, but not by the
metalloprotease inhibitor ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid. This finding
demonstrates that Gln49-PLA(2) is consistent with thrombin-like
properties, and therefore should be a new thrombin-like serine protease.},
