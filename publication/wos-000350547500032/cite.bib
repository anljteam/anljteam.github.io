 abstract = {The dependences of the properties of linear, ring, star, and H-shaped
polymer melts on architecture are investigated by nonequilibrium
molecular dynamics simulations. We find that zero-shear viscosities
eta(0) for various architectures follow a universal relation, eta(0) =
C-eta < R-g0(2)>, where C-eta is a constant and < R-g0(2)> the
equilibrium mean-square radius of gyration, in the unentangled regime.
This law is also found valid for asymmetrical polymers but invalid for
polymers with a hard core, such as stars with many arms and short arm
lengths. In the unentangled regime, from the point of view of polymer
size, the relaxation times show weak dependences on architecture, but
the architecture dependence of the diffusion coefficient is still
apparent. Then, we examine unentangled melts of various architectures
having the same size over a wide range of shear rates covering linear
and nonlinear viscoelastic regimes and find that the rheological
quantities, namely, viscosity, first and second normal stress
differences, are independent of architecture. In contrast, the polymer
deformation shows an apparent dependence on architecture in the
nonlinear regime. These findings shall shed significant light on the
nature of rheological behaviors of unentangled melts. (C) 2015 AIP
