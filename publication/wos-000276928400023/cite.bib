 abstract = {The macroscopic and microscopic melt-crystallization kinetics of
poly(trimethylene terphthalate) (PTT)/polycarbonate (PC) blends have
been measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and optical
microscopy (OM). The results are analyzed in terms of the Avrami
equation and the Hoffman-Lauritzen crystallization theory (HL model).
Blending with PC did not change the crystallization mechanism of PTT,
but reduced the crystallization rate compared with that of neat PTT at
the same crystallization temperature. The crystallization rate decreased
with increasing crystallization temperature. The spherulitic morphology
of PTT was influenced apparently by the crystallization temperature and
by the addition of PC. X-ray diffraction shows no change in the unit
cell dimension of PTT was observed after blending. Through the HL
theory, the classical regime II -> III transition was detected for the
neat PTT and the blends. The nucleation parameter (K-g), the
fold-surface free energy (sigma e), and the work of chain folding (q)
were calculated. Blending with PC decreased all the aforementioned
parameters compared with those of neat PIT. POLYM. ENG. SCI.,
