 abstract = {Mouse mast cell protease-4 (mMCP-4) has been linked to autoimmune and
inflammatory diseases, although the exact mechanisms underlying its role
in these pathological conditions remain unclear. Here, we have found
that mMCP-4 is critical in a mouse model of the autoimmune skin
blistering disease bullous pemphigoid (BP). Mice lacking mMCP-4 were
resistant to experimental BP. Complement activation, mast cell (MC)
degranulation, and the early phase of neutrophil (PMN) recruitment
occurred comparably in mMCP-4(-/-) and WT mice. However, without mMCP-4,
activation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 was impaired in cultured
mMCP-4(-/-) MCs and in the skin of pathogenic IgG-injected mMCP-4(-/-)
mice. MMP-9 activation was not fully restored by local reconstitution
with WT or mMCP-4(-/-) PMNs. Local reconstitution with mMCP-4(-/-) MCs,
but not with mMCP-4(-/-) MCs, restored blistering, MMP-9 activation, and
PMN recruitment in mMCP-4(-/-) mice. mMCP-4 also degraded the
hemidesmosomal transmembrane protein BP180 both in the skin and in
vitro. These results demonstrate that mMCP-4 plays two different roles
in the pathogenesis of experimental BP, by both activating MMP-9 and by
cleaving BP180, leading to injury of the hemidesmosomes and
extracellular matrix of the basement membrane zone.},
