 abstract = {The shearing effects of sheared polymer melts on their finally formed
crystalline structures of poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) were investigated by
means of small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide angle X-ray
diffraction (WAXD). The results of WAXD prove that shear has no effects
on the crystal structure of PLLA. The SAXS results demonstrate that both
of the long period and the thickness of crystalline lamellae increase
with rising shear rates when vertical to the shear direction, but
remains constant when being parallel to the shear direction. The
structural changes for samples prepared with different shear temperature
or under the same shear strain but different shear rate were
investigated. The mesophase of polymer melts and shearing effects on
their pre-ordered phase turned out to be the key factor affecting the
crystal structure of PLLA under different shearing conditions.},
