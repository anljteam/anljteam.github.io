 abstract = {The current treatment for liver failure is restricted to surgical liver
transplantation. which is technically complicated, limited by the
shortage of available organs and presents major risks to the patient.
Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) represent promising sources
of hepatocyte-like cells for cell transplantation treatment. However, a
safe and efficient induction method for their differentiation remains to
be defined. Here we further optimized an effective technique by
combining high-dose treatment with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and
ultrasound stimulation. The optimized ultrasound parameter (1.0 W/cm(2)
intensity, 1 MHz frequency, 20% duty cycle, 100 Hz pulse repetition
frequency, 60-s irradiation duration, triple times in three days)
combined with different HGF doses (10, 20 and 50 ng/ml) was used to
treat BMSCs. The results showed that the specific hepatic markers,
including alpha-fetoprotein (alpha FP/AFP), cytokeratin 18 (CK18),
albumin (ALB) and glycogen, were increased in a dose-dependent manner.
Their concentration was then further increased when ultrasound
irradiation was administered (P < 0.05), as indicated by PCR, Western
blot and immunofluorescence staining as well as a glycogen synthesis
test. Furthermore, analysis of the hepatocyte-derived chemokines showed
elevated stromal cell-derived factor lalpha (SDF-1 alpha) and C-X-C
chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) after HGF treatment. Again,
concentrations of those chemokines were further increased by ultrasound
radiation (P < 0.05). The observed increased effect was sustained for 21
days. To summarize, we further defined the optimal combination of HGF
and ultrasound treatment to increase the differentiation and chemotaxis
of BMSCs in a safe, sustained and efficient manner. These findings
provide a new perspective for stem cell orientation in the field of
tissue engineering. (C) 2020 by Radiation Research Society},
