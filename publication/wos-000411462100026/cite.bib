 abstract = {Our recent molecular dynamics simulation results of binary particle
glass-former systems demonstrated that the non-monotonic temperature
T-dependence of the point-to-set dynamic length scale xi(dyn)(c) in
harmonic (HM) systems is not an intrinsic property of bulk liquids but
originates from wall effects. We would expect our results to apply
equally to other simple models, such as Lennard-Jones (LJ) systems.
However, Hocky et al. presented a monotonic T-dependent xi(dyn)(c) in a
LJ system. Therefore, the present work employs molecular dynamics
simulations to investigate the T-dependent behavior of xi(dyn)(c) in the
LJ system employed by Hocky et al. to clarify our expectation. Results
employing a geometry size d that is somewhat smaller than that employed
by Hocky et al. reveal that a non-monotonic behavior exists in the LJ
system. By varying the value of d, we demonstrate that the formation of
a peak in xi(dyn)(c) with respect to T in the LJ system is the natural
result of wall effects. More importantly, a new non-monotonic behavior
is observed, where the temperature at which the ratio of the
characteristic time required for the overlap profile of the system to
decay to a given value for a point near the wall to the corresponding
characteristic time at a point in the center attains a maximum is in
good agreement with the temperature Tmax-c at which xi(dyn)(c) attains a
maximum value, indicating that the non-monotonic behavior of xi(dyn)(c)
with respect to T is a natural property of liquids in a sandwiched
geometry. Furthermore, we find that, contrary to HM systems, where the
values of Tmax-c obtained for all values of d considered were greater
than the mode-coupling temperature T-c, the value of Tmax-c obtained for
LJ systems can be either greater than, equal to, or less than T-c
because an HM system has a stronger finite-size effect than that in a LJ
system, indirectly implying that the conclusion derived from random
first-order transition theory that a dramatic change occurs near T-c
bears no necessary relationship with the non-monotonic evolution of
xi(dyn)(c) with respect to T. Published by AIP Publishing.},
