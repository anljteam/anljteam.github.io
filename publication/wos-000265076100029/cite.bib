 abstract = {Thermoformable bionanocomposites of chitin
whisker-graft-polycaprolactone (CHW-g-PCL) were synthesized by
initiating the ring-opening polymerization of caprolactone monomer onto
the CHW surface under microwave radiation. In this case, the ``graft
from″ strategy contributed to long and dense ``plasticizing″ PCL
tails onto the CHW surface as the key of thermoforming, and, therefore,
Such bionanocomposites were injection-molded as the sheets with a
Structure of cocontinuous phase mediated with the entanglement of
grafted PCL chains. The structure and properties of the molded CHW-g-PCL
sheets were investigated by FTIR, XRD, SEM, DSC, DMTA, contact angle
measurement, and tensile test. With an increase of the PCL content in
CHW-g-PCL, the strength and elongation as well as the hydrophobicity of
the nanocomposites increased at one time. This is the first report on
the thermoformable polymer-grafted nanocrystal derived from natural
polysaccharide. Moreover, such new bionanocomposites with good
mechanical performances could have great potential applications. (C)
