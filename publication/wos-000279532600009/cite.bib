 abstract = {Our previous work showed that baculovirus (Antheraea pernyi nuclear
polyhedrosis virus [ApNPV]) induced a strong innate immunity and
protected chicken from a lethal challenge of bronchitis virus. The
purpose of present study was to determine the chicken Toll-like
receptors (TLRs) used by BV-infected immune cells to induce this immune
response. We first investigated the expression of the Toll-like receptor
(TLR) genes in resting and BV-infected HD11 (chicken macrophage-like
cell line) and DT40 (chicken B cell-like cell line) cells. Expressions
of TLRs were detected in both cell types. After BV stimulation, TLR21
was the only upregulated TLR in HD11 cells, and all the TLRs were
down-regulated in DT40 cells. Since TLR activation generally leads to
cytokine induction, we then determined the expression of IL-12 in the
two cell lines following treatment with BV or oligodeoxynucleotides
(ODN) containing CpG dinucleotides (CpG-ODN). BV and CpG-ODN treatment
induced the expression of IL-12 in HD11 but not in DT40 cells. HD11
cells transfected with siRNA specific for TLR21 significantly diminished
BV- and CpG-ODN-induced IL-12 expression. Therefore, BV and CpG-ODN
stimulated IL-12 expression involved TLR21 signaling and chicken TLR21
may have similar functions to the mammalian TLR9. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
