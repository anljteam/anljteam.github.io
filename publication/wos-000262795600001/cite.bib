 abstract = {The pollen-tube pathway is feasible to transform vector- and selectable
marker-free linear gene cassettes into plants to address the biosafety
issues. However, its transformation frequency is low and the screening
of selectable marker-free transformants by PCR analysis is
time-consuming and expensive. In this Study, a linear GFP cassette
(Ubi-GFP-nos) flanked by 25 bp T-DNA borders was transformed into maize
via the pollen-tube pathway. The forepart of each maize ear was divided
into five segments (segments I-V) at an interval of two rows of kernels.
The segments that were most likely to contain transgenic kernels were
identified by monitoring GFP expression in the immature embryos. A total
of 21 ears were transformed with the linear GFP cassette. Seven out of
19 ears exhibited positive GFP expression in the immature embryos.
Transgenic kernels were primarily identified in segments III and IV. A
total of 121 plants derived from kernels located within segments III and
IV of the remaining two ears were screened by PCR analysis. Six plants
(4.96%) showed the presence of the GFP cassette. Southern blot analysis
showed that the transgenic plants had simple integration patterns. The
identification of transgenic kernels Would Facilitate PCR screening for
marker-free transgenic plants. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights
