 abstract = {Two-component signal system (TCS) is the predominant bacterial
sense-and-response machinery. RpfC/RpfG TCS involved in quorum sensing
molecule Diffuse Signal Factor (DSF) signal perception and transduction
was well studied in many bacteria. However, whether other environmental
factors participating in the signal perception and transduction of
RpfC/RpfG was still unclear. Here, we showed that RpfC/RpfG could
integrate temperature and DSF signal partially controlling the
production of the temperature-dependent protease (SmtP) in S.
maltophilia FF11, a strain isolated from frozen Antarctic hill,
exhibited spoilage potential due to secret more protease at low
temperatures involving in protein degradation. qRT-PCR analysis revealed
rpf system mediating approximately 60% transcription activity of Clp, a
critical transcription factor linking with LotS/LotR, consisting a
signal network controlling completely the SmtP production in previous
study. Protease production was partially reduced in rpfF (coding DSF
synthetase) mutant strains at 15 degrees C or 25 degrees C, not be
increased through addition DSF or overexpression RpfF in WT at 37
degrees C, indicating that DSF was effective for protease production
only at low temperatures in S. maltophilia. Additionally, biochemical
analysis revealed the enzymatic activity of RpfG from strain FF11
cultured at 37 degrees C or DSF-deficient strains grown at 25 degrees C
was significantly reduced compared to that of RpfG from strain FF11
cultured at 25 degrees C. These findings outline an interplay mechanism
that allows S. maltophilia to integrate quorum sensing and temperature
cues controlling protease production, and imply a potential relationship
between two distinct systems of RpfC/RpfG and LotS/LotR.},
