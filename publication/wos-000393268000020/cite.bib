 abstract = {Antheraea pernyi Iflavirus (ApIV) is a virus that is the likely
causative agent of A. pernyi Vomit Disease (AVD). The virus is
maintained in A. pernyi populations as an unapparent infection by as yet
unknown transmission routes. The mechanisms by which an infection
results in AVD are also not yet known. Both these factors were
investigated in this study. A. pernyi larvae were fed or injected with
ApIV, but only injection led to active replication and spread of ApIV to
the head, epidermis, hemocytes, gut, fatbody, ovary and testis. Twenty
percent of ApIV-injected pupae produced ApIV-infected offspring as
adults, proving that ApIV can be transmitted vertically. As a
confirmation of vertical transmission occurring also in nature, 53 A.
pernyi couples were collected from areas where ApIV has been detected.
Eleven of these couples produced ApIV-infected offspring, again pointing
to a vertical transmission of ApIV.},
