 abstract = {Shape editability combined with a self-healing capability and long-term
cycling durability are highly desirable properties for wearable
supercapacitors. Most wearable supercapacitors have rigid architecture
and lack the capacity for editability into desirable shapes. Through
sandwiching hydrogel electrolytes between two electrodes, a suite of
wearable supercapacitors that integrate desirable properties namely:
repeated shape editability, excellent self-healing capability, and
long-term cycling durability is demonstrated. A strategy is proposed to
enhance the long-term cycling durability by utilizing hydrogel
electrolytes with unique cross-linking structures. The dynamic
crosslinking sites are formed by quadruple H bonds and hydrophobic
association, stabilizing the supercapacitors from inorganic ion
disruption during charge-discharge processes. The fabricated
supercapacitors result in the capacitance retention rates of 99.6% and
95.8% after 5000 and 10 000 charge-discharge cycles, respectively,
which are much higher than others reported in the literature.
Furthermore, the supercapacitor sheets can be repeatedly processed into
various shapes without any capacitance loss. The supercapacitors exhibit
a 95% capacitance retention rate after five cutting/self-healing
cycles, indicative of their excellent self-healing performance. To
demonstrate real-life applicability, the wearable supercapacitors are
successfully used to power a light-emitting diode and an electronic
watch.},
