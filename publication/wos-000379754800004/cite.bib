 abstract = {Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels are involved in the proliferation
and transformation of mammary epithelial cells. They are thought to be
related to the development of breast carcinoma, although the exact role
they play in this event remains unclear. In this study, we investigated
whether the expression and function of Kv channels is associated with
Caveolin-1 (Cav-1, a principal component of caveolae) in different cell
lines. We found that expression of Cav-1 correlated with the expression
of Kv channels in mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A, MCF10A-ST1, and
MCF7), and silencing of Cav-1 inhibited the expression of KCNA5
(voltage-gated shaker-related subfamily A, member 5). Immunofluorescence
analysis indicated the colocalization of KCNA5 with Cav-1, whereas
immunoprecipitation suggested a possible interaction between the two
proteins. Overall, our finding indicated that KCNA5 protein may interact
with Cav-1, thereby contributing to the proliferation and early
transformation of mammary cells.},
