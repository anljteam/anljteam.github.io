 abstract = {Effects of chain flexibility on the conformation of homopolymers in good
solvents have been investigated by Monte Carlo simulation. Bond angle
constraint coupled with persistence length of polymer chains has been
introduced in the modified eight-site bond fluctuation simulation model.
The study about the effects of chain flexibility on polymer sizes
reveals that the orientation of polymer chains under confinement is
driven by the loss of conformation entropy. The conformation of polymer
chains undergoing a gradual change from spherical iso-diametric
ellipsoid to rodlike iso-diametric ellipsoid with the decrease of
polymer chain flexibility in a wide region has been clearly illustrated
from several aspects. Furthermore, a comparison of the freely jointed
chain (FJC) model and the wormlike chain (WLC) model has also been made
to describe the polymer sizes in terms of chain flexibility and
quasi-quantitative boundary toward the suitability of the models.},
