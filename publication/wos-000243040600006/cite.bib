 abstract = {The confined crystallization behavior of polycaprolactone (PCL) in thin
and ultrathin films was studied by AFM (atomic force microscopy). It was
found that the crystalline morphology of PCL depended on the film
thickness When the thickness d > 2 R-g ( radius of gyration), the
polymer can crystallize into spherulites; when R-g < d < 2 R-g the
dense-branch morphology and dendrites could be found; when d < R-g, the
``islandsâ€³ structure could be obtained. Moreover, the effects of the
crystallization temperature, substrate and the molecular weight on the
crystalline morphology were discussed. It was shown that the
crystallization of PCL in thin film is a diffusion-controlled
process,and it can be explained by diffusion-limited aggregation.},
