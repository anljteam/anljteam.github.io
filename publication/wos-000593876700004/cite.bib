 abstract = {BackgroundNontraumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (NONFH) is a
highly disabling orthopedic disease in young individuals. Plasminogen
activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) has been reported to be positively
associated with NONFH. We aimed to investigate the dysregulating PAI-1
in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) and vascular cells in
rabbit steroid-induced NONFH.MethodsTo verify the hypothesis that BMMSCs
could promote thrombus formation in a paracrine manner, we collected
exosomes from glucocorticoid-treated BMMSCs (GB-Exo) to determine their
regulatory effects on vascular cells. microRNA sequencing was conducted
to find potential regulators in GB-Exo. Utilizing gain-of-function and
knockdown approaches, we testified the regulatory effect of microRNA in
exosomes.ResultsThe expression of PAI-1 was significantly increased in
the local microenvironment of the femoral head in the ONFH model. GB-Exo
promoted PAI-1 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells and vascular
endothelial cells. We also revealed that miR-451-5p in GB-Exo plays a
crucial role for the elevated PAI-1. Moreover, we identified miR-133b-3p
and tested its role as a potential inhibitor of PAI-1.ConclusionsThis
study provided considerable evidence for BMMSC exosomal miR-mediated
upregulation of the fibrinolytic regulator PAI-1 in vascular cells. The
disruption of coagulation and low fibrinolysis in the femoral head will
eventually lead to a disturbance in the microcirculation of NONFH. We
believe that our findings could be of great significance for guiding
clinical trials in the future.},
