 abstract = {Poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide)
((EO)(n)-(PO)(m)-(EO)(n)) block copolymers, commercially available as
Pluronics (BASF Corp.) and Poloxamers (ICI Corp.), have been widely
applied in medicine, biochemistry, and other fields because of their
ability to form reversible micelles and physical gels in aqueous
solution. Generally, for PEO-PPO-PEO block copolymers with higher
ethylene oxide concentration, the micellization and gelation in aqueous
solution are easier. However, if we introduce the reverse block
copolymer PPO-PEO-PPO into PEO-PPO-PEO aqueous solutions, the
micellization and gelation of the system will be more complex. In this
work, the reverse block copolymer PO14-EO24-PO14 (17R4) was added to the
Pluronics EO20-PO70-EO20 (P123), EO100-PO65-EO100 (F127), and
EO133-PO50-EO133 (F108) aqueous solutions with different molar ratios.
The rheological properties of different mixtures were measured to study
the additive effect on the gelation behavior. The sol-gel transition
temperature of the P123, F127, and F108 solutions shifted to a higher
temperature when 17R4 was added to the solutions. In addition, the
existence of 17R4 greatly affected the stability of gels. These results
help to better understand the gelation of Pluronic aqueous solutions.},
