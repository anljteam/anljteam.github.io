 abstract = {The chain-length dependence of the Flory-Huggins (FH) interaction
parameter is introduced into the FH lattice theory for polydisperse
polymer-blend systems. The spinodals are calculated for the model
polymer blends with different chain lengths and distributions. It is
found that all the related variables r(n), r(w), r(z), and chain-length
distribution, have effects on the spinodals for polydisperse polymer
blends.
The spinodals at different chain lengths.
