 abstract = {The tensile deformation behavior of poly (butylene terephthalate) (PBT)
was characterized at various temperatures. Three distinct regions
associated with the mechanical response at various temperatures were
identified for PBT and the temperature related structure evolution with
deformation was investigated by in situ synchrotron wide-angle X-ray
scattering (WAXS) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) at 30 degrees
C, 70 degrees C, 120 degrees C. Lamella thickening occurs at 120 degrees
C due to the stress-induced melting and reorganization process. The
alpha-beta transition was observed during deformation for PBT samples
stretched at 30 degrees C, 70 degrees C, 120 degrees C. A structure
model was proposed to describe the deformation process of PBT at 30
degrees C, 70 degrees C, 120 degrees C. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All
