 abstract = {The tensile behavior of PBT with different crystallinity was
investigated at various temperatures. It turned out that the origin of
stress whitening is different for PBT crystallized at 100 degrees C and
180 degrees C. The deformation of PBT crystallized at 100 degrees C
involves crazing/tearing and fibrillation at different temperatures. The
complicated fracture morphologies including brittle fracture,
fibrillation and ductile ploughing are linked to the
temperature-dependent deformation mode of PBT crystallized at 180
degrees C. The yield behavior could be described based on the Ree-Eyring
model for PBT crystallized at 100 degrees C and 180 degrees C. The
effect of temperature on Young's modulus, fracture strain and yield
stress was analyzed and the fracture morphology was discussed in detail.},
