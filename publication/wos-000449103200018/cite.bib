 abstract = {Individual circular polyelectrolytes in simple shear flow are studied by
means of mesoscale hydrodynamic simulations, revealing the complex
coupling effects of shear rate, electrostatic interaction, and circular
architecture on their conformational and dynamical properties. Shear
flow deforms the polyelectrolyte and strips condensed counterions from
its backbone. A decrease in condensed counterions alters electrostatic
interactions among charged particles, affecting shear-induced polymer
deformation and orientation. Circular architecture determines the
features of deformation and orientation. At weak electrostatic
interaction strengths, the polyelectrolyte changes its shape from an
oblate ring at small shear rates to a prolate ring at large shear rates,
whereas strong electrostatic interaction strengths are associated with a
transition from a prolate coil to a prolate ring. Circular
polyelectrolytes exhibit tumbling and tank-treading motions in the range
of large shear rates. Further study reveals a similarity between the
roles of intramolecular electrostatic repulsion and chain rigidity in
shear-induced dynamics. Published by AIP Publishing.},
