 abstract = {We employ Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the interaction between
an adsorbing linear flexible cationic polyelectrolyte and a binary fluid
membrane. The membrane contains neutral phosphatidyl-choline, PC) and
multivalent anionic (phosphatidylinositol, PIP2) lipids. We
systematically study the influences of the solution ionic strength, the
chain length and the bead charge density of the polyelectrolyte on the
lateral rearrangement and the restricted mobility of the multivalent
anionic lipids in the membrane. Our findings show that, the
cooperativity effect and the electrostatic interaction of the
polyelectrolyte beads can significantly affect the segregation extent
and the concentration gradients of the PIP2 molecules, and further
cooperate to induce the complicated hierarchical mobility behaviors of
PIP2 molecules. In addition, when the polyelectrolyte brings a large
amount of charges, it can form a robust electrostatic well to trap all
PIP2 and results in local overcharge of the membrane. This work presents
a mechanism to explain the membrane heterogeneity formation induced by
the adsorption of charged macromolecule. (C) 2013 Author(s). All article
