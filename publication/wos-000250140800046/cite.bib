 abstract = {We study the condition of the occurrence of the rim instability in the
solvent-induced dewetting process. Our experimental results show that
the film thickness not only greatly influences the occurrence of the rim
instability, but also influences the wavelength lambda as characterized
by the undulation of the deformed contact line. The molecular weight of
polymer does not almost influence the occurrence of the rim instability
and the wavelength lambda. The wavelength lambda is proportional to the
width of the rim in the rim instability region. The receding contact
angle theta of polymer solutions on substrates in the dewetting process
is an important factor to influence the rim instability in the
solvent-induced dewetting. (C) 2007 American Institute of Physics.},
