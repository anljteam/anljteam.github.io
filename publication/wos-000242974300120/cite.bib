 abstract = {Physical gelation in the concentrated Pluronic F127/D2O solution has
been studied by a combination of small-angle neutron scattering (SANS)
and Monte Carlo simulation. A 15% F127/D2O solution exhibits a sol-gel
transition at low temperature and a gel-sol transition at the higher
temperature, as evidenced by SANS and Monte Carlo simulation studies.
Our SANS and simulation results also suggest that the sol-gel transition
is dominated by the formation of a percolated polymer network, while the
gel-sol transition is determined by the loss of bound solvent.
Furthermore, different diffusion behaviors of different bound solvents
and free solvent are observed. We expect that this approach can be
further extended to study phase behaviors of other systems with similar
sol-gel phase diagrams.},
