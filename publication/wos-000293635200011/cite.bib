 abstract = {Morphologies and structures determined by crystallization of the blocks,
microphase separation of the copolymers, and vitrification of PLLA block
in poly(l-lactide-b-ethylene oxide) (PLLA-b-PEO) copolymers were
investigated using microscopic techniques and synchrotron small angle
X-ray scattering. The PLLA-b-PEO copolymer films were crystallized from
two different annealing processes: melt crystallization (process A) or
crystallized from glass state of PLLA block after quenching from melt
state (process B). The relationship between the crystalline morphology
and microstructure of the copolymers were explored using SAXS. The
morphology and phase structure are predominated by crystallization of
PLLA block, and greatly influenced by microphase separation of the
copolymers. In process B, lozenge-shape and truncated lozenge-shaped
PLLA crystals of nanometer scale can be observed. The crystalline
morphology is markedly affected by the microstructure formed during the
annealing process. Star-shaped morphologies stacked with PLLA single
crystals were observed.},
