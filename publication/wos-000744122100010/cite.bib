 abstract = {Using molecular dynamics simulation, we study shear banding of entangled
polymer melts under a steady shear. The steady shear stress vs shear
rate curve exhibits a plateau spanning nearly two decades of shear rates
in which shear banding is observed, and the steady shear stress remains
unchanged after switching the shear rates halfway in the range of shear
rates within the plateau region. In addition, we find strong correlation
in the location of the shear bands between different shear rates
starting from the same microstate configurations at equilibrium, which
suggests the importance of the inherent structural heterogeneity in the
entangled polymer network for shear banding. Furthermore, for the steady
shear bands persisting to the longest simulated time of 9.0 tau(d0)
(disengagement time), the shear rate in the slow band and the relative
proportion of the bands do not change very much with the increase of
imposed shear rate, but the shear rate in the fast band increases
approximately in proportion to the imposed shear rates, in contradiction
to the lever rule.},
