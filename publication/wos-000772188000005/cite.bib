 abstract = {Using dynamic Monte Carlo simulations based on the bond-fluctuation
model, we systematically investigate the static and dynamic properties
of a tracer ring polymer in a melt composed of linear polymers. Our
results reveal that the mean-square radius of gyration of a cyclic
polymer is independent of the topological constraints between the ring
and linear chains. The scaling exponent (upsilon) of the radius of
gyration R-g similar to N-R(upsilon), where N-R is the ring chain
length, increases from 0.5 to 0.6 as the length of the linear matrix
chains, N-L, decreases, which lies between the two values reported by
Iyer et al. [Macromolecules 2007, 40, 5995] and Lang et al.
[Macromolecules 2012, 45, 7642]. We find that both the structural
relaxation time and self-diffusion coefficient are nearly independent of
N-L for a short ring chain (N-R = 20) and the scaling exponents of N-L
for the self-diffusion coefficient are between -1 and -2 for large N-R
(N-R = 100), which cannot be understood by existing mechanisms,
including the restraint reptation mechanism, the once-threaded
mechanism, and the constraint release mechanism. Furthermore, we propose
a ``touch-threadingâ€³ mechanism, which could be regarded as an
important supplement to the above mechanisms, to describe the structural
relaxation and translational diffusion of a tracer ring in a linear
melt. In addition, when N-L is large, the structural relaxation and
translational diffusion of the tracer ring are decoupled, resulting in a
breakdown of the extended Stokes-Einstein relation. These results
provide fundamental insights into the properties of the ring-linear
blends.},
