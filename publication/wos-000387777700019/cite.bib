 abstract = {Highly-oriented ZnO nanorod arrays on FTO were fabricated by chemical
oxidation of ZnO seed layer deposited by a sol-gel method. We studied
the influence and its mechanism of solution concentration for crystal
seed layer and thereafter growth time for nanorods on the morphology of
nano-arrays, and then further explained the change of wettability and
transparency. By precisely controlling the fabrication of the
nano-arrays, we obtained a superhydrophobic surface with 95% of average
transmittance. Owing to densely growth of nanorod arrays, the surface
was mainly covered by micro-drops with the diameter of ca. 10 mu m under
steady condensation. Moreover, the tiny dew drops could self-eject
during coalescence together and then easily detach from the surface. The
measured results of number density, coverage and average diameter of the
drops therefore kept constant, showing excellent performance of
anti-condensation.},
