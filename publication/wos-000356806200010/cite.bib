 abstract = {A ring polymer is a classical model to explore the behaviors of
biomacromolecules. Compared with its linear counterpart in shear flow,
the ring polymer should be more sensitive to excluded volume and
hydrodynamic interaction attributed to the absence of chain ends. We
carried out multiparticle collision dynamics combined with molecular
dynamics simulation to study the effects of excluded volume and
hydrodynamic interaction on the behaviors of ring polymers in shear
flow. The results show that in the absence of the strong excluded volume
interaction, the ring polymer prefers a two-strand linear conformation
with high deformation and orientation in the flow-gradient plane, and
the tank-treading motion is nearly negligible. Ring polymers without
excluded volume show no significant difference from linear polymers in
the scaling exponents for the deformation, orientation and tumbling
motion. We also observed that the hydrodynamic interaction could
efficiently slow down the relaxation of ring polymers while the scaling
exponents against the Weissenberg number have rarely been affected.},
