 abstract = {The reversible transitions of the lamellae of a crystalline-crystalline
diblock copolymer from the melt to crystallites were studied using
simultaneous small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide-angle X-ray
scattering (WAXS) measurements with synchrotron radiation. A symmetric
poly( ethylene oxide)-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) diblock copolymer was
chosen for this study. We showed in the course of the block copolymer
crystallisation that the time-resolved integrated intensity I-int was
proportional to the product of the volume fractions of the PEO and PCL
phases and the scattering contrast due to the electron density
difference. These results demonstrated that simultaneous SAXS/WAXS
measurements could be used to monitor the crystallisation process in two
domains of different sizes at the same time.},
