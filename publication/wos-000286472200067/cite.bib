 abstract = {Telechelic polyelectrolytes, bearing short hydrophobic blocks at both
ends, will ionize into polyions and their counterions when dissolved in
water. With the variation of concentration, the interplay between short
range attraction and the long range electrostatic interaction as well as
the counterion distribution exerts a major influence on the chain
conformations ( two basic conformations: loop and nonloop, the latter
can be subdivided into three association types: free, dangling, and
bridge), the cluster structure and the forming of a physical gel. For
weak hydrophobic interaction, the relative strong electrostatic
interaction dominates the gelation progress; sol-gel transition occurs
at higher concentrations due to electrostatic screening and mainly
involves the forming of stretched nonloop conformations such as dangling
and bridge. While for strong hydrophobic interaction, the hydrophobic
interaction dominates and the electrostatic interaction provides a
contribution to the formation of gels by maintaining a spatial swelling
structure, resulting in a much lower concentration region of sol-gel
transition; besides, the sol-gel transition is characterized by the
competition of the forming of loop and bridge chains. (C) 2011 American
