 abstract = {Gln49-PLA(2) is a phospholipase A(2) isolated from the Gloydius
ussurensis snake venom. In this paper, we studied its effect on the
function of neural conduction. Electrophysiological studies demonstrated
that Gln49-PLA(2) reduced the amplitude of the action potential and the
velocity of nerve conduction on isolated mouse sciatic nerve. Patch
clamp recordings confirmed that Gln49-PLA(2) significantly decreased
neural excitability by the potentiation of sodium channels and the
blockade of potassium channels in nerve terminal. In freshly isolated
hippocampal pyramidal neurons, 54.25% of potassium current was
inhibited by 20 mu g/ml Gln49-PLA(2). However, sodium current was
potentiated by 158.99% under the same condition. These findings
demonstrate that the effect of Gln49-PLA(2) on ion channels is the main
mechanism of analgesic action.},
