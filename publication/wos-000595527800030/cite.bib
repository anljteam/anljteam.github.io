 abstract = {The effect of functionality on the migration behaviors, structural, and
dynamical properties of star polymers in Poiseuille flow are
investigated by multiparticle collision dynamics integrated with
molecular dynamics simulations. Our studies reveal that the star polymer
migrates toward the centerline of the cylindrical tube by increasing the
flow strength and the degree of inward migration is amplified as the
functionality or the number of monomers increases. At high flow
strengths, the star polymer with low functionality undergoes a large
conformational change due to the tumbling motion, and the tumbling
motion is suppressed with increasing functionality, whereas the star
polymer with high functionality maintains a steady, stretched state via
a trumpet shape. We attribute this phenomenon to the fact that the star
polymer with high functionality perturbs the surrounding solvents more
strongly at high flow strengths than that with lower functionality,
leading to the higher additional hydrodynamic drag forces. These forces
are balanced by certain forces in each direction and stabilize the
high-functionality star polymer near the centerline due to its
trumpet-shaped configuration. Hence, the trumpet structure of star
polymers amplifies the inward migration of polymer chains in Poiseuille
flow.},
