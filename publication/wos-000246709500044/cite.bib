 abstract = {The morphological development and crystallization behavior of
poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) in miscible mixtures of PCL and
poly(vinyl methyl ether) (PVME) were investigated by optical microscopy
as a function of the mixture composition and crystallization
temperature. The results indicated that the degree of crystallinity of
PCL was independent of the mixture composition upon melt crystallization
because the glass-transition temperatures of the mixtures were much
lower than the crystallization temperature of PCL. The radii of the PCL
spherulites increased linearly with time at crystallization temperatures
ranging from 42 to 49 degrees C. The isothermal growth rates of PCL
spherulites decreased with the amount of the amorphous PVME components
in the mixtures. Accounting for the miscibility of PCL/PVME mixtures,
the radial growth rates of PCL spherulites were well described by a
kinetic equation involving the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter and
the free energy for the nuclei formation in such a way that the
theoretical calculations were in good agreement with the experimental
data. From the analysis of the equilibrium melting point depression, the
interaction energy density of the PVME/PCL system was calculated to be
-3.95 J/cm(3). (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
