 abstract = {Using Brownian dynamics simulation, we determine chain dimensions in an
entangled polymer melt undergoing startup shear at a rate lower than the
reciprocal of the Rouse time yet higher than the reciprocal reptation
time. Here the tube model expects negligible chain stretching. In
contrast, our simulation shows the deformed coil to conform closely to
affine deformation. We find that the total number of entanglements
decreases with increasing shear. Remarkably, up to many Rouse time, the
decline in the number of initial entanglements is slower than that under
the quiescent condition. These results point to fundamental deficiencies
in the molecular picture of the tube model for startup shear.},
