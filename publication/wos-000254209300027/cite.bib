 abstract = {The conformation of bovine serum albumin (BSA), as well as its
interactions with negatively charged mica surfaces in saline solutions
of different pH values, have been studied by small-angle neutron
scattering (SANS) and chemical force microscopy (CFM), respectively. A
new approach to extract the contribution of elementary interactions from
the statistically averaged force-extension curves through
self-consistent fitting was proposed and used to understand the effects
of pH on the interactions and conformation of BSA in saline solutions.
When pH increases, the SANS results reveal that the sizes of BSA
molecules increase slightly, while the statistical analysis of the CFM
results shows that the averaged pull-off force for the elongation
monotonously decreases. The decrease of pull-off force with the increase
of pH results from the decrease in the strength of hydrogen bonding and
the number of interaction pairs, as well as the slight increase of the
strength of van der Waals interaction. When pH approaches the
isoelectric point (pI) of BSA, results from both SANS and CFM suggest a
loss of long-range interactions in BSA molecules. Our results also
suggest that the force-extension curve is mainly contributed by the van
der Waals interaction. The combination of SANS and CFM provides new
insight to understand the interactions and conformation of BSA
molecules.},
