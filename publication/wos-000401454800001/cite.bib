 abstract = {It has been broadly accepted that the behavior of glass-forming liquids,
where their relaxation dynamics exhibit a pronounced slowdown as they
are cooled toward the glass transition temperature, is caused by the
increase in one or more correlation lengths. However, the role of length
scales in the dynamics of glass-forming liquids is not clearly
established, and past simulation work that suggests a surprising
nonmonotonic temperature evolution of spatial dynamical correlations
near the mode-coupling crossover temperature has been both questioned
and supported by subsequent work. Here, using molecular dynamics
simulation, we also show a striking maximum in the dynamic length scale
xi(dyn)(c) at a given temperature, but the temperature of this maximum
is found to shift as the size of the confined system increases.
Furthermore, we find that such a maximum disappears for all geometry
sizes considered when a rough wall is replaced with a smooth, hard wall,
suggesting that the nature of the nonmonotonic temperature dependence of
xi(dyn)(c) does not reflect an intrinsic property of bulk liquids, but
originates from wall effects. Our results provide new insights into the
dynamics of glass-forming liquids, particularly for
quasi-two-dimensional systems.},
