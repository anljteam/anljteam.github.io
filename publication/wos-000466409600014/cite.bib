 abstract = {We systematically investigated the morphological evolution of thin
polymer blend films via annealing in mixed solvents. Here, a simple and
efficient approach was proposed to fabricate different complex polymer
nanostructures based on the dewetting of polymer blend films in mixed
solvent. First, the nanobowl structures of poly (methyl methacrylate)
and pi-conjugated
polymer-poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] were
fabricated using this method. In addition, we also found that reversible
dynamic transition among complex polymer structures could be achieved.
This allowed us to reversibly adjust the complex structures by different
external stimuli. Finally, it was determined that various arrays of
complex polymer nanostructures, such as Janus nanostructures, core-shell
nanostructures, nanobowls, nanochannels, and nanotubes, could be
fabricated by pre-patterning the thin polymer blend films.},
