 abstract = {In order to understand the coarsening of microdomains in symmetric
diblock copolymers at the late stage, a model for block copolymers is
proposed. By incorporating the self consistent field theory with the
free energy approach Lattice Boltzmann model, hydrodynamic interactions
can be considered. Compared with models based on Ginzburg-Landau free
energy, this model does not employ phenomenological free energies to
describe systems. The model is verified by comparing the simulation
results obtained using this method with those of a dynamical version of
the self consistent mean field theory. After that,the growth exponents
of the characteristic domain size for symmetric block copolymers at late
stage are studied. It is found that the viscosity of the system affects
the growth exponents greatly, although the growth exponents are all less
than 1/3 Furthermore, the relations between the growth exponent, the
interaction parameter and the chain length are studied. The rescaled
simulation results show that the dependence of growth exponent on the
interaction parameter is trivial; however,the length of the polymer
chain may lead to the change of the growth exponent. This conclusion is
different from that based on a free energy function given by the
Ginzburg Landau expression. This difference may come from the additional
correlation considered in the self consistent field theory of our model.
Nevertheless, the chain length effect on the growth exponent is little
compared with that of the fluid viscosity.},
