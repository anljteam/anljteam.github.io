 abstract = {Glass formers exhibit a pronounced slowdown in dynamics, accompanied by
progressive heterogeneity as they approach the glass transition. There
is intense debate over whether the dramatic slowdown is caused by
dynamical heterogeneity and whether the enhanced dynamical heterogeneity
originates from structural causes. However, the connection between
dynamical heterogeneity and the spatial distribution of the
single-particle free volume (a purely static structural quantity) was
found to be rather weak, which raises the question of whether dynamic
heterogeneity has a purely structural origin. Here, by introducing the
concept of local-average free volume, we present numerical evidence that
long-time dynamic heterogeneity shows significantly enhanced correlation
with the average local free volume over a length scale of a few
neighboring shells. Our results resolve the long-standing controversy
about whether free volume plays an important role in particle
rearrangements associated with the activated hopping relaxation. The
concept of ``local averageâ€³ can be applied to other local structural
descriptors to better correlate with dynamic heterogeneity in
glass-forming liquids.},
