 abstract = {Reactive mold filling is one of the important stages in resin transfer
molding processes, in which resin curing and edge effects are important
characteristics. On the basis of previous work, volume-averaging
momentum equations involving viscous and inertia terms were adopted to
describe the resin flow in fiber preform, and modified governing
equations derived from the Navier-Stokes equations are introduced to
describe the resin flow in the edge channel. A dual-Arrhenius viscosity
model is newly introduced to describe the chemorheological behavior of a
modified bismaleimide resin. The influence of the curing reaction and
processing parameters on the resin flow patterns was investigated. The
results indicate that, under constant-flow velocity conditions, the
curing reaction caused an obvious increase in the injection pressure and
its influencing degree was greater with increasing resin temperature or
preform permeability. Both a small change in the resin viscosity and the
alteration of the injection flow velocity hardly affected the resin flow
front. However, the variation of the preform permeability caused an
obvious shape change in the resin flow front. The simulated results were
in agreement with the experimental results. This study was helpful for
optimizing the reactive mold-filling conditions. (C) 2009 Wiley
