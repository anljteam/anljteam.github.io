 abstract = {Amphiphilic supramolecular miktoarm star copolymers linked by ionic
bonds with controlled molecular weight and low polydispersity have been
successfully synthesized via reversible addition-fragmentation chain
transfer (RAFT) polymerization using an ion-bonded macromolecular RAFT
agent (macro-RAFT agent). Firstly, a new tetrafunctional initiator,
dimethyl 4,6-bis(bromomethyl)-isophthalate, was synthesized and used as
an initiator for atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of styrene
to form polystyrene (PSt) containing two ester groups at the middle of
polymer chain. Then, the ester groups were converted into tertiary amino
groups and the ion-bonded supramolecular macro-RAFT agent was obtained
through the interaction between the tertiary amino group and
2-dodecylsulfanylthiocarbonylsulfanyl-2-methyl propionic acid (DMP).
Finally, ion-bonded amphiphilic miktoarm star copolymer,
(PSt)(2)-poly(N-isopropyl-acrylamide)(2), was prepared by RAFT
polymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) in the presence of the
supramolecular macro-RAFT agent. The polymerization kinetics was
investigated and the molecular weight and the architecture of the
resulting star polymers were characterized by means of H-1-NMR, FTIR,
and GPC techniques. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
