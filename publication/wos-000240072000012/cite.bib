 abstract = {``Nano-onions″ with multifold alternating CdS/CdSe or CdSe/CdS
structure have been synthesized via a two-phase approach. The influences
of shell on photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields (QYs) and PL lifetimes
are investigated and discussed. It is found that the outmost shell plays
an important role in the PL QYs and PL lifetimes of the multishells
``onion-like″ nanocrystals. The PL QYs and PL lifetimes fluctuate
regularly with CdSe and CdS shells. The PL QY increases when the
nanocrystals have an outmost CdS shell; however, it decreases
dramatically with the outmost CdSe shell. The trend of the change of PL
lifetimes is consistent with that of the QYs. The crystal structure and
composition of the novel nano-onions are characterized by transmission
electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectra
techniques.},
