 abstract = {Molecular weight dependence of phase separation behavior of the Poly
(ethylene oxide) (PEO)/Poly(ethylene oxide-block-dimethylsiloxane)
(P(EO-b-DMS)) blends was investigated by both experimental and
theoretical methods. The cloud point curves of PEO/P(EO-b-DMS) blends
were obtained by turbidity method. Based on Sanchez-Lacombe lattice
fluid theory (SLLFT), the adjustable parameter, epsilon*(12)/k
(quantifying the interaction energy between different components), was
evaluated by fitting the experimental data in phase diagrams. To
calculate the spinodals, binodals, and the volume changes of mixing for
these blends, three modified combining rules of the scaling parameters
for the block copolymer were introduced. The calculated binodals with
those modified combining rules show good agreement with the experimental
data. Furthermore, the calculated volume changes during mixing decrease
with increasing molecular weight of PEO, and the relationship between
the volume changes and temperature is quite different for the mixtures
with different molecular weight of PEO. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
