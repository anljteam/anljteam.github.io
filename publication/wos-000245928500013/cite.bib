 abstract = {The reactive extrusion for polymerization is an integrated polymer
processing technology. A new semi-implicit iterative algorithm was
proposed to deal with the complicated relationships among the chemical
reaction, the macromolecular structure and the chemorheological
property. Then the numerical computation expressions of the average
molecular weight, the monomer conversion, and the initiator
concentration were deduced, and the computer simulation of the reactive
extrusion process for free radical polymerization was carried out, on
basis of which reactive processing conditions can be optimized.},
