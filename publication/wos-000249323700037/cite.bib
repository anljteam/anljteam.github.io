 abstract = {The effects of blend composition on morphology, order-disorder
transition (ODT), and chain conformation of symmetric ABA/AB copolymer
blends confined between two neutral hard walls have been investigated by
lattice Monte Carlo simulation. Only lamellar structure is observed in
all the simulation morphologies under thermodynamic equilibrium state,
which is supported by theoretical prediction. When the composition of AB
diblock copolymer (phi) increases, both lamellar spacing and the
corresponding ODT temperature increase, which can be attributed to the
variation of conformation distribution of the diblock and the triblock
copolymer chains. In addition, both diblock and triblock copolymer,
chains with bridge conformation extend dramatically in the direction
parallel to the surface when the system is in ordered state. Finally,
the copolymer chain conformation depends strongly on both the blend
composition and the incompatibility parameter chi N.},
