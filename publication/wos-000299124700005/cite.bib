 abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient for plant growth and
development, but is generally unavailable and inaccessible in soil,
since applied P is mostly fixed to aluminium (Al) and ferrum (Fe) in
acidic soils and to calcium (Ca) in alkaline soils. Increased organic
acid excretion is thought to be one mechanism by which plants use to
enhance P uptake. In this study, we overexpressed a mitochondrial malate
dehydrogenase (MDH) gene from the mycorrhizal fungi Penicillium oxalicum
in tobacco. The MDH activity of transgenic lines was significantly
increased compared to that of wild type. Malate content in root
exudation of transgenic lines induced in response to P deficiency was
1.3- to 2.9-fold greater than that of wild type under the same
condition. Among the transgenic lines that were selected for analysis,
one line (M1) showed the highest level of MDH activity and malate
exudate. M1 showed a significant increase in growth over wild type, with
149.0, 128.5, and 127.9% increases in biomass, when grown in
Al-phosphate, Fe-phosphate, and Ca-phosphate media, respectively. M1
also had better P uptake compared to wild type, with total P content
increased by 287.3, 243.5, and 223.4% when grown in Al-phosphate,
Fe-phosphate, and Ca-phosphate media, respectively. To our knowledge,
this is the first study on improving the ability of a plant to utilize P
from Al-phosphate, Fe-phosphate, and Ca-phosphate by manipulating the
organic acid metabolism of the plant through genetic engineering.},
