 abstract = {Monte Carlo simulations are employed to investigate the adsorption of a
flexible linear cationic polyelectrolyte onto a fluid mixed membrane
containing neutral (phosphatidyl-choline, PC), multivalent
(phosphatidylinositol, PIP2), and monovalent (phosphatidylserine, PS)
anionic lipids. We systematically study the effect of chain length and
charge density of the polyelectrolyte, the solution ionic strength, as
well as the membrane compositions on the conformational and interfacial
properties of the model system. In particular, we explore (i) the
adsorption/desorption limit, (ii) the interfacial structure variations
of the adsorbing polyelectrolyte and the lipid membrane, and (iii) the
overcharging of the membrane. Polyelectrolyte adsorbs on the membrane
when anionic lipid demixing entropy loss and polyelectrolyte flexibility
loss due to adsorption are dominated by electrostatic attraction between
polyelectrolyte and anionic lipids on the membrane. Polyelectrolytes
with longer chain length and higher charge density can adsorb on the
membrane with increased anionic lipid density under a higher critical
ionic concentration. Below the critical ionic concentration, the
adsorption extent increases with the charge density and chain length of
the polyelectrolyte and decreases with the ionic strength of the
solution. The diffusing anionic lipids prohibit the polyelectrolyte
chain from forming too long tails. The adsorbing polyelectrolyte with
long chain length and high charge density can overcharge a membrane with
low charge density, and conversely, the membrane charge inversion forces
the polyelectrolyte chain to form extended loops and tails in the
solution.},
