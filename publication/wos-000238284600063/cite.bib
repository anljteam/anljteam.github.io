 abstract = {By using a combinatorial screening method based on the self-consistent
field theory (SCFT) for polymers, we have investigated the morphology of
H-shaped ABC block copolymers (A(2)BC(2)) and compared them with those
of the linear ABC block copolymers. By changing the ratios of the volume
fractions of two A arms and two C arms, one can obtain block copolymers
with different architectures ranging from linear block copolymer to
H-shaped block copolymer. By systematically varying the volume fractions
of block A, B, and C, the triangle phase diagrams of the H-shaped ABC
block copolymer with equal interactions among the three species are
constructed. In this study, we find four different morphologies (
lamellar phase ( LAM), hexagonal lattice phase ( HEX), core-shell
hexagonal lattice phase (CSH), and two interpenetrating tetragonal
lattice (TET2)). Furthermore, the order-order transitions driven by
architectural change are discussed.},
