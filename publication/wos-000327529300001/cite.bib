 abstract = {The dielectric relaxation spectroscopy results indicate that the
relaxation peak of PCL for pure PCL and PCL/LiClO4 complexes shifts to a
lower frequency with increasing crystallization temperature, while the
amorphous, condensed structure of PCL for pure PCL and PCL/LiClO4
complexes is slightly affected by crystallization temperature. These
findings were obtained from small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)
measurements. To further understand the effect of crystallization
temperature on the relaxation behavior of PCL and PCL/LiClO4 complexes,
the isothermal crystallization process of PCL and PCL/LiClO4 was probed
in situ by dielectric spectra measurement. The analysis indicated that
the relaxation dynamics for pure PCL and PCL/LiClO4 complexes decrease
continuously during the isothermal crystallization process, even at the
crystallization induction period. This paper presents a detailed
discussion of the crystallization mechanisms of the PCL and PCL/LiClO4
complexes, and the probable explanation as to the effect of
crystallization temperature on the relaxation dynamics of PCL and
PCL/LiClO4 .},
