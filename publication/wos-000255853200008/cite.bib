 abstract = {Catalpol, an iridoid glycoside abundant in the roots of Rehmannia
glutinosa, has been previously found to prevent the loss of CA1
hippocampal neurons and to reduce working errors in gerbils after
ischemia-reperfusion injury. In the present study, we investigated the
effects of catalpol on astrocytes in an ischemic model to further
characterize its neuroprotective mechanisms. Primary cultured astrocytes
exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by reperfusion
(adding back oxygen and glucose, OGD-R), were used as an in vitro
ischemic model. Treatment of the astrocytes with catalpol during
ischemia-reperfusion increased astrocyte survival significantly in a
concentration-dependent manner, as demonstrated by
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assay, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and morphological
observation. In addition, catalpol prevented the decrease in
mitochondrial membrane potential, inhibited the formation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and the production of nitric oxide (NO), decreased
the level of lipid peroxide and the activity of inducible nitric oxide
synthase (iNOS), and elevated the activities of superoxide dismutase
(SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and the content of glutathione
(GSH). Our results suggest that catalpol exerts the most significant
cytoprotective effect on astrocytes by suppressing the production of
free radicals and elevating antioxidant capacity. (C) 2008 ISDN.
