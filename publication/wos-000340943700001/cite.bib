 abstract = {Monte Carlo simulation is employed to investigate the interaction
between a polyelectrolyte and a fluid mixed membrane containing neutral
(phosphatidyl-choline, PC), monovalent anionic (phosphatidylserine, PS),
and multivalent anionic (phosphatidylinositol, PIP2) lipids. The effects
of the intrinsic polyelectrolyte rigidity and solution ionic strength on
the lateral rearrangement and dynamics of different anionic lipid
species are systematically studied. Our results show that, the increase
of polyelectrolyte chain rigidity reduces the loss of polyelectrolyte
conformational entropy and the energy gains in electrostatic
interaction, but raises the demixing entropy loss of the segregated
anionic lipids. Therefore, the polyelectrolyte/membrane adsorption
strength exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the polyelectrolyte
rigid parameter k(ang), and there exists a certain optimal k(ang) for
which the adsorption strength is maximal. Because the less loss of chain
conformational entropy dominates the increase of the demixing entropy
loss of the segregated anionic lipids and the decreases of the
electrostatic energy gains, the semiflexible polyelectrolyte adsorbs
onto the membrane more firmly than the flexible one. Whereas, for the
adsorption of rigid polyelectrolyte, larger anionic lipid demixing
entropy loss and less energy gain in the electrostatic interaction
dominate over the decrease of the polyelectrolyte conformation entropy
loss, leading to the desorption of the chain from the membrane. By
decreasing the ionic concentration of the salt solution, the certain
optimal k(ang) shifts to larger values. The cooperative effects of the
adsorbing polyelectrolyte beads determine the concentration gradients
and hierarchical mobility of the bound anionic lipids, as well as the
polyelectrolyte dynamics.},
