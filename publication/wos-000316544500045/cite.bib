 abstract = {Using a set of hyperbranched polystyrenes with different overall molar
masses but a uniform subchain length or a similar overall molar mass but
different subchain lengths, we studied their sizes and hydrodynamic
behaviors in toluene (a good solvent) at T = 25 degrees C by combining
experimental (laser light scattering (LLS) and viscometry) and
theoretical methods based on a partially permeable sphere model. Our
results show that both the average radii of gyration (< Rg >) and
hydrodynamic radius (< Rh >) are scaled to the weight-average molar mass
(Mw) as < R-g > similar to < R-h > similar to (MwMw,s phi)-M-gamma with
gamma = 0.47 +/- 0.01 and phi = 0.10 +/- 0.01; and their intrinsic
viscosity ([eta]) quantitatively follow the Mark- Houwink-Sakurada
(MHS) equation as [eta] = K-eta M-w M-nu(w,s) (mu) with K-eta = 2.26 x
10(-5),. nu = 0.39 +/- 0.01, and mu = 0.31 +/- 0.01, revealing that
these model chains with long subchains are indeed fractal objects.
Further, our theoretical and experimental results broadly agree with
each other besides a slight deviation from the MHS equation for short
subchains, similar to dendrimers, presumably due to the multi- body
hydrodynamic interaction. Moreover, we also find that the average
viscometric radius (< R-eta >) determined from intrinsic viscosity is
slightly smaller than < R-h > measured in dynamic LLS and their ratio (<
R eta >/< Rh >) roughly remains 0.95 +/- 0.05, reflecting that linear
polymer chains are more draining with a smaller < R-h > than their
hyperbranched counterparts for a given intrinsic viscosity. Our current
study of the `` defect- freeâ€³ hyperbranched polymer chains offers a
standard model for further theoretical investigation of hydrodynamic
behaviors of hyperbranched polymers and other complicated architectures,
in a remaining unexploited research field of polymer science. (C) 2013
