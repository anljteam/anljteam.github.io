 abstract = {The functionalization of monomer units in the form of macroinitiators in
an orthogonal fashion yields more predictable macromolecular
architectures and complex polymers. Therefore, a new there exists
E-shaped amphiphilic block copolymer,
(PMMA)(2)-PEO-(PS)(2)-PEO-(PMMA)(2) [where PMMA is poly(methyl
methacrylate), PEO is poly (ethylene oxide), and PS is polystyrene], has
been designed and successfully synthesized by the combination of atom
transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and living anionic
polymerization. The synthesis of meso-2,3-dibromosuccinic acid
acetate/diethylene glycol was used to initiate the polymerization of
styrene via ATRP to yield linear (HO)(2)-PS2 with two active hydroxyl
groups by living anionic polymerization via diphenylmethylpotassium to
initiate the polymerization of ethylene oxide. Afterwards, the
synthesized miktoarm-4 amphiphilic block copolymer, (HO-PEO)(2)-PS2, was
esterified with 2,2-dichloroacetyl chloride to form a macroinitiator
that initiated the polymerization of methyl methacrylate via ATRP to
prepare the there exists E-shaped amphiphilic block copolymer. The
polymers were characterized with gel permeation chromatography and H-1
NMR spectroscopy. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
