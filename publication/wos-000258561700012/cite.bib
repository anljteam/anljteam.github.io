 abstract = {We have previously evaluated the neuroprotective effect of catalpol on
aging mice induced by D-galactose, in which catalpol treatment
ameliorated cognition deficits and attenuated oxidative damage in mice
brain. To thoroughly elucidate the anti-aging effects of catalpol, the
liver and spleen antioxidative systems and energy metabolism in
senescent mice induced by D-galactose have been studied. Except control
group, mice were subcutaneously injected with D-galactose (150 mg kg(-1)
body weight) for 6 weeks. Meanwhile, drug group mice were treated with
catalpol (2.5, 5, 10mg kg(-1) body weight) and piracetam (300mg kg(-1)
body weight) for the last 2 weeks. The activities of endogenous
antioxidants and the level of glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxide in
the liver and spleen were assayed. Compared to control group, model
group mice had significantly lower spleen index (spleen weight/body
weight), lower level of GSH, lower activities of superoxide dismutase
(SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), higher level of
malondialdehyde (MDA) in the liver and spleen. However, catalpol
administration markedly reversed these effects of senescence induced by
D-galactose. Simultaneously, catalpol noticeably elevated the decreased
activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glutamine synthetase (GS),
Na+-K+-ATPase, Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase and decreased the elevated activity of
creatine kinase (CK) in mice liver or spleen. These results implied that
the anti-aging effects of catalpol were achieved at least partly by
promoting endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities and normalizing
energy disturbance. Catalpol may be a potential anti-aging agent and
worth testing for further preclinical study aimed for senescence or
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
