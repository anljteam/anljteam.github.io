 abstract = {In this work, the film thickness (l(0)) effect on the phase and
dewetting behaviors of the blend film of poly(methyl methacrylate)/poly
(styrene-ran-acrylonitrile) (PMMA/SAN) has been studied by in situ
atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). The thinner film shows the more compatibility of the blend, and
the phase separation of the film occurs at l(0) > 5R(g) (radius of
gyration). An initially time-independent q*, the characteristic
wavenumber of the phase image, which is in good agreement of Cahn's
linearized theory for the early stage of spinodal decomposition, has
been obtained in real space and discussed in detail. For 5R(g) > l(0) >
3R(g), a ``pseudo-dewetting/(phase separation + wetting)″ behavior
occurs, where the pseudo-wetting is driven by the concentration
fluctuation mechanism. For 10 < 3R(g), a ``real dewetting/(phase
separation + wetting)″ behavior occurs.},
