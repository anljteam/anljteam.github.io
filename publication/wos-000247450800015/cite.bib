 abstract = {A new initiator for atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), (Cl-2
HCCOO)(3) -C-6 H-3, (TrDCAP),has been designed and successfully
synthesized. ATRP of styrene was carried out by using TrDCAP as
hexafunctional initiator and the CuCl/bpy catalyst at 130 degrees C in
30% THF via core-first strategy. The Arm-6 PS-AAP was synthesized by
etherealization of Arm-6 PS and 4-(4'-methoxyphenylazomethine) phenol
(AAP). The initiator and the architectures of the Arm-6 PS were
confirmed by H-1-NMR, FT-IR, UV-Vis and GPC.},
