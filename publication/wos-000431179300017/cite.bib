 abstract = {Structural relaxation and glass transition in binary hard-spherical
particle mixtures have been reported to exhibit unusual features
depending on the size disparity and composition. However, the mechanism
by which the mixing effects lead to these features and whether these
features are universal for particles with anisotropic geometries remains
unclear. Here, we employ event-driven molecular dynamics simulation to
investigate the dynamical and structural properties of binary
two-dimensional hard-ellipse mixtures. We find that the relaxation
dynamics for translational degrees of freedom exhibit equivalent trends
as those observed in binary hard-spherical mixtures. However, the glass
transition densities for translational and rotational degrees of freedom
present different dependencies on size disparity and composition.
Furthermore, we propose a mechanism based on structural properties that
explain the observed mixing effects and decoupling behavior between
translational and rotational motions in binary hard-ellipse systems.},
