 abstract = {Penicillium pinophilum was isolated from the soil in a commercial
strawberry field. The strain readily formed arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM)
with the roots of strawberry `Zoji' (Fragaria x ananassa Duch. CV.) when
plants were inoculated with either fresh cultured hyphae or root/soil
mixtures. Fresh hyphae, however, resulted in higher amounts of
colonization than root/soil inoculum. Compared with uninoculated
strawberries, inoculation increased plant dry weight by 31%, as well as
nitrogen content (47%), phosphorus content (57%), and photosynthetic
rate (71%). AM inoculation also shortened the blossom and ripening date
by 3 and 4 days, respectively. This is the first report of a P.
pinophilum strain resulting in mycorrhiza with strawberry roots. The
significant advantages of this strain are that it is easy to culture and
inoculation of plants results in significant growth benefits that may be
useful in strawberry production.},
