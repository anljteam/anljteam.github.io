 abstract = {One of the most important issues for spin-coated diblock copolymer thin
films is to distinguish the blocks by common techniques, especially for
the diblock copolymers containing one block could form active domain.
Aiming different estimations on the composition of surface microdomains
in polystyrene-block-poly (4-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P4VP) atomic force
microscope (AFM) phase images, AFM, transmission electron microscopy,
and droplet shape analyzer were used to identify the constructional
details of the polymer thin film morphology. It was confirmed that PS
block is harder than P4VP block in symmetric PS-b-P4VP films and
corresponds to brighter regions in AFM phase image. It is helpful to
distinguish the nanodomains that originate from the different blocks in
PS-b-P4VP thin films. The structure evolutions of PS-b-P4VP film
annealed with different selective solvents were studied and discussed.
The results indicated that the core-corona inversion process is due to
the cores of micelles swell and coalesce together rather than local
reorganization of the chains. (C) 2013 Elsevier.Inc. All rights
