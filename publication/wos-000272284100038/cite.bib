 abstract = {The structural and performance inhomogeneities of gelatin gel can
directly affect its application as a kind of functional material. The
structural inhomogeneity of gelatin caused by the uneven and unstable
temperature field has been analyzed by the finite element method in our
previous work. Further in this paper, the performance inhomogeneity of
gelatin which is closely connected with the actual application is
numerically analyzed during the gelation process, which includes the
inhomogeneities of the optical and mechanical properties of gelatin
gels. The time required for reaching the gel point at different spatial
grids is exhibited and discussed. The calculated results also show that
the equilibrium shear modulus of gelatin is dependent on the thermal
history. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
