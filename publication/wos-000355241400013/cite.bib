 abstract = {The conformational, orientational and dynamical properties of single
flexible ring polymers under simple shear flow are studied by a hybrid
multiparticle collision dynamics simulation method. We found that
contributing to the continuous stretching and constant alignment in the
tank-treading motion, ring polymers undergo weaker deformation and
orientation in the gradient direction, and show similar behaviors in the
voracity direction compared with their linear analogues. We also present
the mechanisms of both tumbling and tank-treading motions based on the
time trajectories of relative deformation and orientation. Furthermore,
the simulation results reveal that the special structures and unique
dynamics of ring polymers in simple shear flow have an obvious influence
on rheological properties, which are qualitatively different from the
properties of linear polymers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights
