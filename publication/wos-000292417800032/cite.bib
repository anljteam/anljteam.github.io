 abstract = {Using in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) and grazing incidence
ultrasmall-angle X-ray scattering (GIUSAX), the composition dependence
of phase separation, dewetting, and interplay between them in blend
[poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(styrene-ran-acrylonitrile)
(SAN)] ultrathin films (similar to 1R(g), radius of gyration) on silicon
oxide substrate was investigated. It was found that phase behaviors
depended crucially on the composition in blend. First, dewetting
morphologies in SAN50 and SAN70 were still under the control of U(q0)/E,
which was introduced in our previous work [Polymer 2009, 50, 4456] to
distinguish different dewetting pathways. Here, U(q0) and E described
the initial amplitude of the surface undulation and original thickness
of film, respectively; second, composition produced significant
influences on its gradient in composition fluctuation, resulting in the
accelerated (or suppressed) dewetting; last, this kind of acceleration
or suppression affected the following interplay between phase separation
and dewetting so much. Using two samples of ``dewetting/wetting-phase
separation″ and ``wetting-dewetting/phase separation″ with
different components, we discussed the interplay mechanism of them in
detail. In conclusion, our results indicate that dewetting, phase
separation, and the following interplay between them are sensitive to
composition in blend. Furthermore, composition gradient plays an
important role in them.},
