 abstract = {The novel phase field model with the ``polymer characteristicâ€³ was
established based on a nonconserved spatiotemporal Ginzburg-Landau
equation (TDGL model A). Especially, we relate the diffusion equation
with the crystal growth faces of polymer single crystals. Namely, the
diffusion equations are discretized according to the diffusion
coefficient of every lattice site in various crystal growth faces and
the shape of lattice is selected based on the real proportion of the
unit cell dimensions. Spatiotemporal growth of syndiotactic
polypropylene single crystals during isothermal crystallization has been
investigated theoretically based on this phase field model. Two
dimensional numerical calculations are performed to elucidate the
faceted single crystal growth including square, rectangular,
lozenge-shaped, and hexagonal single crystals. Our simulated patterns
are in good agreement with the experimental morphologies, and the
physical origin of polymer single crystal growth is discussed.},
