 abstract = {Seafood is sometimes wasted due to the growth of psychrotolerant
microbes which secrete proteases and break down proteins.
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia FF11, isolated from frozen Antarctic krill,
grows at a wide range of temperatures and secretes more proteases at low
temperatures. According to zymogram analysis, two kinds of proteases
were produced from this strain. A major protease was produced largely at
15 A degrees C, but not at 37 A degrees C. The temperature-dependent
secreted protease was purified to homogeneity. Its molecular mass was
determined at 37.4 kDa and its amino acid sequence was also obtained.
This protease is a member of the subtilase group according to the NCBI
blast analysis. The enzyme was highly stable at high salt concentration
(4 M). Interestingly, its activity increased about 1.6-fold under high
salt condition. The enzyme remains active and stable in different
organic solvents (50 %, v/v) such as dimethylsulfoxide, dimethyl
formamide, dioxane and acetone. These properties may provide potential
applications in quality control for sea foods, in protein degradation at
high salt concentration, in biocatalysis and biotransformation within
non-aqueous media, such as detergent and transesterification.},
