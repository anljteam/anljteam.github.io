 abstract = {Thin films of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and
poly(styrene-ran-acrylonitrile) (SAN) blend can phase separate upon
heating to above its critical temperature. Temperature dependence of the
surface composition and morphology in the blend thin film upon thermal
treatment was studied using in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) and in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM). It was found that in
addition to phase separation, the blend component preferentially
diffused to and aggregated at the surface of the blend film, leading to
the variation of surface composition with temperature. At 185 degrees C,
above the critical temperature, the amounts of PMMA and SAN phases were
comparable. At lower temperatures PMMA migrated to the surface, leading
to a much higher PMMA surface content than in the bulk. The migration
and preferential segregation of a blend component in thin films
demonstrated here are responsible for the great difference between in
situ and ex situ experimental (not real quenching or annealing) results
of polymer blend films, and help explain the slow kinetics of surface
phase separation at early stage for blend thin films reported in
literature. This is significant for the control of surface properties of
polymer materials. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
