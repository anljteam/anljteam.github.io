 abstract = {We use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the interactions between
cationic semiflexible polymer chains and a model fluid lipid monolayer
composed of charge-neutral phosphatidyl-choline (PC), tetravalent
anionic phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and univalent
anionic phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids. In particular, we explore how
chain rigidity and polymer concentration influence the spatial
rearrangement and mobility heterogeneity of the monolayer under the
conditions where the cationic polymers anchor on the monolayer. We find
that the anchored cationic polymers only sequester the tetravalent PIP2
lipids at low polymer concentrations, where the interaction strength
between the polymers and the monolayer exhibits a non-monotonic
dependence on the degree of chain rigidity. Specifically, maximal
anchoring occurs at low polymer concentrations, when the polymer chains
have an intermediate degree of rigidity, for which the PIP2 clustering
becomes most enhanced and the mobility of the polymer/PIP2 complexes
becomes most reduced. On the other hand, at sufficiently high polymer
concentrations, the anchoring strength decreases monotonically as the
chains stiffena result that arises from the pronounced competitions
among polymer chains. In this case, the flexible polymers can confine
all PIP2 lipids and further sequester the univalent PS lipids, whereas
the stiffer polymers tend to partially dissociate from the monolayer and
only sequester smaller PIP2 clusters with greater mobilities. We further
illustrate that the mobility gradient of the single PIP2 lipids in the
sequestered clusters is sensitively modulated by the cooperative effects
between anchored segments of the polymers with different rigidities. Our
work thus demonstrates that the rigidity and concentration of anchored
polymers are both important parameters for tuning the regulation of
anionic lipids.},
