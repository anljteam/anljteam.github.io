 abstract = {We employed coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulations to investigate a
system composed of cationic polymers and a phosphatidyl-choline membrane
monolayer, doped with univalent anionic phosphatidylserine (PS) and
tetravalent anionic phosphatidylinositol 4,S-bisphosphate (PIP2) lipid
molecules. For this system, we consider the conditions under which
multiple cationic polymers can anchor onto the monolayer and explore how
the concentration and ionization degree of the polymers affect the
lateral rearrangement and fluidity of the negatively charged lipids. Our
work shows that the anchoring cationic polymers predominantly bind the
tetravalent anionic PIP2 lipids and drag the PIP2 clusters to migrate on
the monolayer. The polymer/PIP2 binding is found to be drastically
enhanced by increasing the polymer ionization fraction, which causes the
PIP2 lipids to form into larger clusters and reduces the mobility of the
polymer/PIP2 complexes. As expected, stronger competition effects
between anchoring polymers occur at higher polymer concentrations, for
which each anchoring polymer partially dissociates from the monolayer
and hence sequesters a smaller PIP2 cluster. The desorbed segments of
the anchored polymers exhibit a faster mobility on the membrane, whereas
the PIP2 dusters are closely restrained by the limited adhering cationic
segments of anchoring polymers. We further demonstrate that the PIP2
molecules display a hierarchical mobility in the PIP2 clusters, which is
regulated by the synergistic effect between the cationic segments of the
polymers. The PS lipids sequester in the vicinity of the polymer/PIP2
complexes if the tetravalent PIP2 lipids cannot sufficiently neutralize
the cationic polymers. Finally, we illustrate that the increase in the
ionic concentration of the solution weakens the lateral clustering and
the mobility heterogeneity of the charged lipids. Our work thus provides
a better understanding of the fundamental biophysical mechanism of the
concentration gradients and the hierarchical mobility of the anionic
lipids in the membrane caused by the cationic polymer anchoring on
length and time scales that are generally inaccessible by atomistic
models. It also offers insight into the development and design of novel
biological applications on the basis of the modulation of signaling
lipids.},
