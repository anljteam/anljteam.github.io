 abstract = {C2 was isolated from the rhizosphere of Mexican stonecrop based on its
high level of tricalcium phosphate solubilizing activity. A full-length
gene encoding mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (mMDH) was cloned from
C2 by RT-PCR and RACE techniques. The cDNA was 1,284 bp in length, with
a complete open reading frame of 1,023 bp encoding a protein of 340
amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 35.7 kDa. The predicted
amino acid sequence shared high identity with mMDHs from other
organisms. strain BL21(DE3) transformed with the C2 mMDH gene showed an
increase in MDH activity of about 5-fold compared to non-transformed
cell as measured in cell extracts. It also secreted more malate,
lactate, acetate, citrate, oxalate and produced higher clearing halos
when grown in plates with tricalcium phosphate as the sole source of
phosphate. These results showed that expression of the C2 mMDH gene in
could enhance organic acid secretion and improve the phosphate
solubilizing ability of the cell.},
