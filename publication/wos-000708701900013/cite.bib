 abstract = {Developing strategies for assembling ionic polymers into nanoaggregates
with desired properties confers effective routes for the fabrications of
functional materials. In dilute aqueous solutions, ionomers (composed of
a hydrophobic backbone chain and grafted anionic pendant segments)
normally self-assemble into small and dispersed clusters due to the
electrostatic repulsions. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics
simulations, we develop a simple, convenient, but novel approach for
fabricating large ionomer microparticles in dilute aqueous solutions. We
demonstrate that added cationic polyelectrolytes (PEs) could
electrostatically bind the dispersed ionomers and trigger their
self-assembly into microparticles composed of a hydrophobic core and an
anionic shell. The size of the microparticles could be precisely
controlled by adjusting the concentration and chain length of the
binding PEs. Furthermore, bare microparticles can be obtained through PE
desorption in saline solution. We examine the mechanical and
thermodynamic stability of the ionomer microparticle and its
shape-memory nature in response to external force and temperature.
Moreover, our simulations on electrophoresis reveal that a mobility
reversal of the microparticles occurs due to overcharging of the binding
PE. This work contributes to the development of novel strategies to
fabricate smart polymer aggregates with predesigned structures and
functions.},
