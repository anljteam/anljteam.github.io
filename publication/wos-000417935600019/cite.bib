 abstract = {Structural responses of unentangled polymers of various architectures,
including linear, ring, star, asymmetric star, and H-shaped polymers, in
steady shear flow are investigated via nonequilibrium molecular dynamics
simulations. As observed in our previous simulations, these polymers,
when having an identical equilibrium mean-square radius of gyration < R
(2) (g0)> exhibit the same viscosity curve in both the linear and
nonlinear regimes. In this article, the polymer orientation and
deformation and the rate of deformation are calculated as a function of
shear rate. The differences between different architectures in most of
these properties are found to be related to the polymer extensibility,
the number of free ends and the ability of folding. The unique
architecture-independent quantity is the gradient component < G (yy) >
of the radius of gyration tensor. We find that a simple relation eta=C
(eta) < R (2) (g0)>(3 < G (yy) >/< R (2) (g0)>)(3/2) gives a
near-perfect fit to shear viscosity eta data, where C (eta) is a
constant. The results suggest that this relation between chain thickness
and viscosity is universal for unentangled polymers of various
architectures.},
