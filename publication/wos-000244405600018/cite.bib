 abstract = {The crystallization behaviors of poly( E-caprolactone) (PCL) in
poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) and poly(vinyl methyl ether) (PVME)
blends were investigated by POM, DSC, WAXD, SAXS. POM results indicated
that spherical crystal morphology was present during isothermal process,
and the spheric growth rates were reduced with increasing the contents
of PVME in PCL/PVME blends. It was found that the crystallinity of PCL
in the blends remained almost constant regardless of the blend
composition, but it was dependent on preparation technique.
Solution-crystallization was found to be a technique capable of
increasing crystallinity levels for some compositions. The melting
behavior of the blends is a rather complex process. Both
solution-crystallized samples and isothermal-crystallized samples
exhibited a single endotherm. Oppositely, melting-crystallized samples
exhibited dual-melting endotherms whose mangnitudes vary with blend
compositions. On the basis of WAXD and SAXS experiments, it is found
that the crystal structure is unchanged, but the long period increases
with increasing the content of PVME because of the thickening of the
amorphous layers.},
