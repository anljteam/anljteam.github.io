 abstract = {The synthesis of a novel ABC ternary segregated H-shaped copolymer is
described, of which a central poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chain is
terminated on both sides by polystyrene (PS) and
poly(tert-butylacrylate) (PtBA) chains. The synthetic procedure involves
functionalization of PEG by 2-bromosuccinic anhydride followed by
esterification of 1,6-hexanediol, which gives its ends the bifunctional
nature that allows sequential growth of two PS, then two PtBA arms via
atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). The resulting segregated
H-shaped copolymers were characterization by NMR spectroscopy and gel
permeation chromatography (GPC). All these copolymers were affirmed to
have well-defined structures and narrow molecular weight distributions.
