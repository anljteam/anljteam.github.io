 abstract = {To analyze the complicated relationships among the variables during the
reactive extrusion process of polyamide 6 (PA6), and then control the
chemical reaction and the material structures, the process of continuous
polymerization of caprolactam into PA6 in a closely intermeshing
co-rotating twin screw extruder was simulated by means of the finite
volume method, and the influences of three key processing parameters on
the reactive extrusion process were discussed. The simulated results of
an example were in good agreement with the experimental results. (c)
