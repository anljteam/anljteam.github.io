 abstract = {On the basis of the quantitative relationship among rubber processing,
structure and property, the methodology of the integrated
processing-structure-property analysis on rubber in-mold vulcanization
is presented, and then the temporal evolution and spatial distribution
characteristics of silicone rubber hot processing parameters,
crosslinking structure parameters and mechanical property parameters are
obtained by means of the finite element method. The present work is
helpful for optimizing curing conditions, and then the design of rubber
vulcanization processes according to certain requirements can be done.
