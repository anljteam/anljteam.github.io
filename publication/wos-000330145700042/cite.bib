 abstract = {Individual semiflexible ring polymers in a steady shear flow are studied
by the multiparticle collision dynamics method combined with molecular
dynamics simulations. We report the effects of chain stiffness on the
conformational, dynamical, and rheological properties of ring polymers.
When the Weissenberg numbers are smaller than unity, the behavior of
semiflexible ring polymers is consistent with that of flexible ones. For
larger Weissenberg numbers, the effects of chain stiffness are observed.
We find that the radius of gyration tensor elements, the orientation
resistance parameter, and the alignment distribution functions show
strong stiffness dependences. The scaling behavior of tumbling motion
corresponding to large conformational changes is found independent of
chain stiffness, while the scaling behavior of tank-treading motion
corresponding to the motion of monomers moving along the contour of the
chain exhibits a chain stiffness dependence in the crossover regime from
a flexible to a rigid ring polymer. Chain rigidities are found to have
negligible effects on the polymer shear viscosity. The simulations
reveal the similarities and differences in the nonequilibrium behavior
of flexible and semiflexible ring polymers.},
