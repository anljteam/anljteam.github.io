 abstract = {Gelatin is widely used in food, pharmaceutical, and photographic
industries due to the coil-helix transition, whereas the structural
inhomogeneity considerably affects its essential properties closely
connecting with the industrial applications. The spatially structural
inhomogeneity of the gelatin caused by the uneven and unstable
temperature field is analyzed by the finite element method during the
cooling-induced coil-helix transition process. The helix conversion and
the crosslinking density as functions of time and spatial grid are
calculated by the incremental method. A length distribution density
function is introduced to describe the continuous length distributions
of two kinds of triple helices. The results show that the crosslinking
density and the length distribution of triple helices are dependent on
the thermal histories. And the spatially structural inhomogeneity is
more distinct when the initial gelatin concentration and the convective
heat transfer coefficient increase. The present work is helpful for
optimizing the fabrication conditions of gelatin. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
