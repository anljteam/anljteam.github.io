 abstract = {We present a novel method for obtaining salt polarizabilities in aqueous
solutions based on our recent theory for the refractive index of salt
solutions, which predicts a linear relationship between the refractive
index and the salt concentration at low concentrations, with a slope
determined by the intrinsic values of the salt polarizability and the
density of the solution. Here we apply this theory to determine the
polarizabilities of 32 strong electrolyte salts in aqueous solutions
from refractive index and density measurements. Setting Li+ as the
standard ion, we then determine the polarizabilities of seven cations
(Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+, Ca2+, Ba2+, and Sr2+) and seven anions (F-, Cl-,
Br-, I-, ClO4-, NO3-, and SO42-), which can be used as important
reference data. We investigate the effect of temperature on salt
polarizabilities, which decreases slightly with increasing temperature.
The ion polarizability is found to be proportional to the cube of bare
ionic radius (r(bare)(3)) for univalent ions, but the relationship does
not hold for multivalent ions. Contrary to findings of Krishnamurti, we
find no significant linear relationship between ion polarizability and
the square of the atomic number (N-2) for smaller ions.},
