 abstract = {Experimental observations on micromorphologies around broken fibers in
glass-fiber-reinforced epoxy matrix composites reveal different kinds of
highly oriented patches at the circumambience of broken fibers, whereas
the bulk of the matrix has been observed to be largely isotropic. These
patches are interpreted to correlated areas where the stress gradients
of the matrix are formed after fiber breaking, but the underlying cause
for the orientation is still unknown. The authors have modified an
embedded cell model to explain the experimental phenomena. The finite
element simulation indicates that the surfaces around broken fibers
display a change from an extension micromorphology to a mixed tension
and shear micromorphology with the increase of applied strain.},
