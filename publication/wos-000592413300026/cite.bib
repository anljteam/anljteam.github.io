 abstract = {Knotting is common in long polymers and significantly affects the
polymer behavior. It is generally believed that knotting should increase
polymer bending energy. However, many recent studies found that knotting
can surprisingly decrease polymer bending energy, while the reason
remains unclear. In this work, we quantitatively explained this
surprising phenomenon using the tube model. In this model, polymer
segments in a knot core are confined in a virtual tube. The tube affects
the bending of knots in two opposite ways. First, the tube is curved to
assume a knotted shape, which increases the bending. Second, the tube
confinement suppresses the bending. We built a phase diagram to quantify
the competition of these two effects. The second effect overwhelms under
certain conditions because of two crucial yet often overlooked factors:
(i) excluded volume interactions reduce the accessible diameter of the
tube and (ii) polymer segments tend to escape the tube and thus produce
an entropic force, which straightens the conformation. Overall, this
work clarifies the special role of bending in polymer knots and
demonstrates the usefulness of the tube model for polymer knots.},
