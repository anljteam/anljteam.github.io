 abstract = {The mechanism of inhibition of polymer film dewetting is investigated by
adding a star comb-like polymer, four-arm P(S-ran-VB-g-PMMA), to PS film
and PMMA film on different substrates. It is found that the mechanism of
inhibition of polymer film dewetting is kinetic in nature, and is
related to the miscibility between the additional compound and the
polymer film. On addition to the miscible system [four-arm
P(S-ran-VB-g-PMMA) and PMMA], the star comb-like polymers can increase
the resistant force of dewetting with hole growth and inhibit the
dewetting process of the thin polymer film by enrichment in the rim. To
the immiscible system [four-arm P(S-ran-VB-g-PMMA) and PS], firstly
the four-arm P(S-ran-VB-g-PMMA) enriches the solid substrate and forms
nanodroplets in the process of spin-coating, and then PS film dewets on
these nanodroplets; however, the star comb-like polymer can inhibit the
dewetting of the polymer film only when the contact angle theta of the
polymer on the additional four-arm P(S-ran-VB-g-PMMA) is smaller than
that of the polymer on the substrate.},
