 abstract = {Transport of star polymers under pressure-driven flow in a pipe with
pipe radius being at least twice the size of polymers has been examined
with standard dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations
Equilibrium dynamics of star polymers in bulk solution were found to
obey the Zimm model very well, indicating that DPD simulation correctly
incorporates the hydrodynamic interaction in the stars Under
pressure-driven flow, star polymers with more arms were found to migrate
toward the center of pipe more, leading to a net faster velocity and
hence a shorter retention time in the pipe The stretching of star
polymers along the flow was found to follow similar scaling behavior as
the linear polymer chains, except that the Weissenberg number W-t for
the stars should be reduced by arm number f After rescaling of the
Weissenberg number, the stretch ratio S-v defined as the ratio of square
of radius gyration of the chains along the flow, kg.,2, over its col
responding value in dilute bulk solution, was found to scale with W-t
linearly when W-t >> 1 The compression of the chains in the dimension
per pendicular to the flow were found to scale with W-t(-0 5) when W-t
>> I 0},
