 abstract = {The force- and flow-induced translocation processes of linear and ring
polymers are studied using a combination of multiparticle collision
dynamics and molecular dynamics, focusing on the behavior of the polymer
translocation time. We compare the force- and flowinduced translocations
of linear and ring polymers. It is found that when the translocation
time (tau*) is characterized by scaling exponents, delta, delta', and
alpha, via the relations tau* similar to f(phi)N(alpha) and tau*
similar to J(delta)'N-alpha, the scaling exponents are not constants.
For long chains tested, alpha = 1.0 for both forceand flow-induced
translocations. The difference between the force- and flow-induced
translocations stems from different monomer crowding effects due to
distinct flow patterns outside the channel. Furthermore, general
relations for polymer translocation time are derived for these two
translocation processes, which are in good agreement with the simulation
results. Our results provide clear molecular pictures for the force- and
flow-induced translocations, which shed light on the understanding of
translocation dynamics and provide guidance for practical applications
such as molecular sequencing and ultrafiltration.},
