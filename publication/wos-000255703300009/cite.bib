 abstract = {Camptothecin is a topoisomerase I inhibitor with definite anti-psoriatic
effect. As it is limited in clinical application because of serious side
effects and toxicity, many researchers are striving hard to develop
derivatives or analogues of camptothecin with higher effects and less
toxicity. To explore the anti-psoriatic potential of isocamptothecin, a
novel camptothecin analogue, its effects on proliferation, apoptosis and
telomerase activity were investigated in the human keratinocyte cell
line HaCaT. Incubation with isocamptothecin resulted in a time- and
concentration-dependent inhibition of HaCaT cell proliferation. However,
isocamptothecin showed larger inhibitory concentration at 50% than
camptothecin, suggesting far less cytotoxicity. In addition,
isocamptothecin induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner
and induced typical morphologic features of apoptosis in HaCaT cells.
Moreover, isocamptothecin downregulated the telomerase activity of HaCaT
cells not only at concentrations of apoptosis induction but also at
concentration insufficient to induce apoptosis, providing additional
mechanisms that further account for its ability to inhibit keratinocytes
proliferation and induce apoptosis. These results indicate that
isocamptothecin possesses similar effects on keratinocytes with
camptothecin, but shows far less cytotoxicity, it may probably become a
promising agent for psoriasis therapy.},
