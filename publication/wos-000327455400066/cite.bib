 abstract = {Near-infrared laser provides a novel nerve stimulation modality to
regulate the cell functions. Understanding its physiological effect is a
prerequisite for clinic laser therapy applications. Here, the whole-cell
sodium (Na) channel kinetics of neuron cell was employed to determine
the temporal roles of infrared laser. The Na currents were elicited by
electrical pulses that were synchronized at the rising and falling edges
of the 980 nm laser pulses, respectively, to investigate the different
infrared effect on cell functions. The time constants of activation (tau
(m)) and inactivation (tau (h)) kinetics were extracted from fitting of
the Na current (m(3)h) according to the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model. By
comparing the time constants without and with the laser irradiation, we
obtained that laser pulses changed the Na current kinetics by
accelerating tau (h)-phase and slowing down tau (m)-phase at the
beginning of the laser pulse, whereas both phases were accelerated at
the end of the pulse. After relating the ratios of the time constants to
the temperature characteristics of Na channel by Q (10), we found that
the accelerating in Na current kinetics could be related to the average
temperature of extracellular solution in the corresponding time span by
choosing Q (10) = 2.6. The results of this study demonstrated that there
was a positive correlation between the acceleration of the Na current
kinetics and increases in temperature of the extracellular solution.},
