 abstract = {A special kind of associating polyelectrolytes, telechelic
polyelectrolytes, composed of a flexible linear polyelectrolyte and
short hydrophobic blocks at both ends, is investigated by means of Monte
Carlo simulations ill aqueous media. It is found that the interplay
between hydrophobic attraction and the long-range electrostatic
interaction as well as the counterion distribution exerts a major
influence on the chain conformations (two basic conformations: loop and
nonloop), association behavior (loop association contributes to loop
conformation; free, dangling, and bridge chains contribute to nonloop
conformations), and the forming of clusters. At a concentration close to
the overlapping concentration phi*, the Clusters are found to be
further connected by bridge chains under strong hydrophobic interaction,
forming a 3D network. In addition, increasing Coulombic interaction
strength is in favor of the formation of a gel network. With increasing
Coulombic interaction strength, first chains tend to extend and then
tend to collapse due to the screening originating from the counterion
condensation layer.},
