 abstract = {A combined experimental and computational study is presented to uncover
the dewetting kinetics of the PS/PMMA system by changing the film
thickness of the PMMA under layer. On the low M(w), PMMA (M(w) = 15
kg/mol) layer, the dewetting velocity of PS film firstly rapidly
decreases (regime I), and then becomes almost invariant (regime II) with
the increase of the film thickness of the liquid lower layer.
Experiments suggest that the transition from regime I to regime II is
correlative with the property of the solid substrates. The linear
stability analysis of thin bilayers uncovers a bimodal behaviour of the
instability under the experimental conditions and changeover of dominant
mode of instability from one interface to the other is the major reason
behind the switching of regimes. The nonlinear simulations closely mimic
the experimental interfacial morphologies and suggest two different
pathways of hole growth for regimes I and II under experimental
condition. The simulations also indicate that the rapid reduction in the
dewetting velocity is because of the increased excursion or penetration
of the upper layer into the lower layer near the three phase contact
line as the viscous resistance at the more viscous PMMA layer reduces
with its increasing thickness. A qualitative match is thus found between
the experimental and theoretical trends of the dewetting velocities. In
addition, the experiments show that on a high M(w) PMMA (M(w) = 365
kg/mol) layer, the kinetics of hole growth of the PS layer is not
affected by the PMMA layer thickness. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights
