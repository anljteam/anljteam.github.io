 abstract = {Micelle clusters and square slices that formed in different
polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO) solutions were observed
with AFM. This diblock copolymer assembled into small spherical micelles
and then micelle clusters (diameters: 100-400 nm) after the
PS-b-PEO/toluene solution had been aged for 24 h at room temperature.
Square slices were obtained from solutions aged for two months. Solvent
vapor induced morphological and structural transitions of the micelle
clusters and the stability of the square slices on Si wafers were
investigated. The results showed that the solvent vapor induced
morphology of the sample aged for 24 h was more ordered than that aged
for two months. Possible mechanisms for the formation of these
structures in the solutions and the vapor-induced structural transition
were proposed.},
