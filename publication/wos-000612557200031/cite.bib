 abstract = {Salt-induced liquid-liquid phase separation in liquid mixtures is a
common phenomenon in nature and in various applications, such as in
separation and extraction of chemicals. Here, we present results of a
systematic investigation of the phase behaviors in
water-acetonitrile-salt mixtures using a combination of experiment and
theory. We obtain complete ternary phase diagrams for nine
representative salts in water-acetonitrile mixtures by cloud point and
component analysis. We construct a thermodynamic free energy model by
accounting for the nonideal mixing of the liquids, ion hydration,
electrostatic interactions, and Born energy. Our theory yields phase
diagrams in good agreement with the experimental data. By comparing the
contributions due to the electrostatic interaction, Born energy, and
hydration, we find that hydration is the main driving force for the
liquid-liquid separation and is a major contributor to the specific ion
effects. Our theory highlights the important role of entropy in the
hydration driving force. We discuss the implications of our findings in
the context of salting-out assisted liquid-liquid extraction and make
suggestions for selecting salt ions to optimize the separation
performance.},
