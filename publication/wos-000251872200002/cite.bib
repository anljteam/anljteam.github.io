 abstract = {The free radical grafting of polyethylene with vinyl monomers by
reactive extrusion was studied numerically. Numerical computation
expressions of key variables, such as the concentrations of the
initiator and polymer, grafting degree, average molecular weight and
apparent viscosity, were deduced. The evolutions of the above variables
were predicted by means of an uncoupled semi-implicit iterative
algorithm. The monomer conversion monotonically increases with
decreasing throughput or increasing initial initiator concentration;
with increasing barrel temperature, the monomer conversion first
increases then decreases. The simulated results are nearly in good
agreement with the experimental results.},
