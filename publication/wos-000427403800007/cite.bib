 abstract = {Hyperhydricity can cause significant economic loss for the
micro-propagation industry that produces blueberry. In order to predict
and control the occurrence of hyperhydricity, better understanding of
the anatomical and physiological features of hyperhydric plantlets is
required. In this study, we investigated the ultrastructural and
physiological changes associated with hyperhydric blueberry plantlets.
Compared to normal plantlets, hyperhydric plantlets exhibited reduced
cell wall thickness, damaged membrane and guard cell structure,
decreased number of mitochondria and starch granule, higher cell
vacuolation, more intercellular spaces, and collapse of vascular
tissues. In addition, excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and ethylene, decreased stomatal aperture and water loss, as well
as abnormity of stomatal movement were also evident in the hyperhydric
plantlets. The results suggested that excessive ethylene and ROS
produced in response to the stress arising from in vitro culture could
lead to abnormal stomatal closure, causing the accumulation of water in
the tissues. This would lead to subsequent induction of oxidative stress
(due to hypoxia) and cell damage, especially guard cell structure,
eventually giving rise to the symptoms of hyperhydricity. Reducing the
content of ethylene and ROS, and protecting the structure and function
of the stomata could be considered as potential strategies for
inhibiting hyperhydricity or restoring the hyperhydric plants to their
normal state.},
