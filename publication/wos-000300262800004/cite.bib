 abstract = {Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease
associated with autoantibodies against the hemidesmosomal proteins BP180
and BP230. In the IgG passive transfer model of BP, blister formation is
triggered by anti-BP180 IgG and depends on complement activation, mast
cell degranulation, and neutrophil recruitment. Mice lacking neutrophil
elastase (NE) do not develop experimental BP. Here, we demonstrated that
NE degrades recombinant mouse BP180 within the immunodominant
extracellular domain at amino add positions 506 and 561, generating
peptide p561 and peptide p506. Peptide p561 is chemotactic for
neutrophils both in vitro and in vivo. Local injection of NE into B6
mice recruits neutrophils to the skin, and neutrophil infiltration is
completely blocked by co-injection with the NE inhibitor alpha
1-proteinase inhibitor. More importantly, NE directly cleaves BP180 in
mouse and human skin, as well as the native human BP180 trimer molecule.
These results demonstrate that (i) NE directly damages the extracellular
matrix and (ii) NE degradation of mouse BP180 generates neutrophil
chemotactic peptides that amplify disease severity at the early stage of
the disease. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
