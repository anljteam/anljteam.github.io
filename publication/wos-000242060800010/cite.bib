 abstract = {The damage evolution of fiber-reinforced polypropylene-matrix composites
with matrix defects was studied via a Monte Carlo technique combined
with a finite element method. A finite element model was constructed to
predict the effects of various matrix defect shapes on the stress
distributions. The results indicated that a small matrix defect had
almost no effect on fiber stress distributions other than interfacial
shear stress distributions. Then, a finite element model with a
statistical distribution of the fiber strength was constructed to
investigate the influences of the spatial distribution and the volume
fraction of matrix defects on composite failure. The results showed that
it was accurate to use the shear-lag models and Green's function methods
to predict the tensile strength of composites even though the axial
stresses in the matrix were neglected. (C) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
