 abstract = {A multiphasic model for the volume change of polyelectrolyte hydrogels
that takes into account conservation of mass and momentum is derived.
The gradient of chemical/electrochemical potentials of water and mobile
ions is taken as the driving force for the volume change of the
polyelectrolyte hydrogel, which is damped by the frictional forces
between different phases and balanced by the elastic restoring force of
the polymer network. Employing the model constructed here, the free
swelling of a spherical polyelectrolyte hydrogel immersed in salt
solution is simulated by the finite element method. The simulation shows
that the polyelectrolyte hydrogel swells from the surface to the
interior when the concentration of the external salt solution decreases.
The swelling kinetics for ordinary hydrogels with high frictional
coefficient between the polymer network and water is controlled by the
collective diffusion of the polymer network, while for fast-response
hydrogels it is controlled by the ionic diffusion in the hydrogel. (C)
