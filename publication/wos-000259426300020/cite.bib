 abstract = {A novel ion-bonded discotic complex was prepared from
2,3,6,7,10,11-hexakis(N,N-dimethylaminopropylaminocarbonylmethoxy)triphe
nylene (HDTP) and 4'-dodecyloxybiphenyl-4-carboxylic acid (DBC) by ionic
self-assembly (ISA) route and characterized by Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectrum. We found that the complex can self-assemble
into stable gels in aromatic hydrocarbons. Nanofibers with diameters of
50-130 nm were observed in the gels by transmission electron micrograph
(TEM). The FTIR data in conjunction with UV-vis and fluorescence spectra
suggested that the aggregation of the complex into elongated fibers in
solution was induced by a directional extended network of hydrogen bonds
and pi-pi interactions. Based on the experiment analysis, we proposed a
tentative model of the self-assembly of this two-component gel-phase
material. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
