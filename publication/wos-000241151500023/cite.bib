 abstract = {The stress transfer from broken fibers to unbroken fibers in
fiber-reinforced thermosetting polymer-matrix composites and
thermoplastic polymer-matrix composites was studied using a detailed
finite element model. In order to check the validity of this approach,
an epoxy-matrix monolayer composite was used as thermosetting
polymer-matrix composite and a polypropylene (PP)-matrix monolayer
composite was used as thermoplastic polymer-matrix composite,
respectively. It is found that the stress concentrations near the broken
fiber element cause damage to the neighboring epoxy matrix prior to the
breakage of other fibers, whereas in the case of PP-matrix composites
the fibers nearest to the broken fiber break prior to the PP matrix
damage, because the PP matrix around the broken fiber element yields. In
order to simulate composite damage evolution, a Monte Carlo technique
based on a finite element method has been developed in the paper. The
finite element code coupled with statistical model of fiber strength
specifically written for this problem was used to determine the stress
redistribution. Five hundred samples of numerical simulation were
carried out to obtain statistical deformation and failure process of
composites with fixed fiber volume fraction. The result indicates that
the moderate interfacial shear sliding strength can weaken the adverse
effect of fiber breaks on composite strength, resulting in the increase
of the average strength of composites. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights
