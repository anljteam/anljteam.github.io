 abstract = {This work aims to find a better solution from an improved genetic
programming (GP) algorithm for classification problems without
increasing computation costs as far as possible. Firstly, the standard
GP algorithm is difficult to succeed in finding better individuals since
too large search landscape and it is easy to run into local optimum when
evolution reaches a certain stage, while, by enlarging the evolutionary
generation or the size of population might increase computation
complexity. So, a two-stage GP may be a good solution for these. In the
first stage, GP is used to induce a relatively simple classifier and
construct features; in the second stage, GP is executed on these
features to evolve a better classifier. Secondly, in order to improve
the convergence, a new initialization (NI) strategy and a new function
operator selection method are designed. In this paper, a NI strategy
based two-stage GP algorithm (NITGP) is proposed, and compares with the
standard GP on a set of artificial, real-world datasets and image edge
detection tasks. The experimental results show that our approach can
evolve classifiers with better performance.},
