 abstract = {Film thickness dependence of complex behaviors coupled by phase
separation and dwelling in blend [poly(methyl methacrylate) (PM MA)
and poly(styrene-i an-acrylonitrile) (SAN)] filins on silicon oxide
substrate at 175 degrees C was investigated by grazing incidence
ultrasmall-angle X-ray scattering (GIUSAX) and in situ atomic force
microscopy (A FM) It was found that the dewetting pathway was under the
control of the parameter U-q0/E, which described the initial amplitude
of the surface undulation and original thickness of film, respectively
Furthermore, our results showed that interplay between phase separation
and dewetting depended crucially on film thickness Three mechanisms
including dewetting-phase separation/wetting, dewetting/wetting-phase
separation, and phase separation/wetting-pseudodewetting were discussed
in detail In conclusion, it is relative rates of phase separation and
dewetting that dominate the interplay between them},
