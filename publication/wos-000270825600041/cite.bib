 abstract = {Self-assembled behavior of T-shaped rod-coil block copolymer melts is
studied by applying self-consistent-field lattice techniques in
three-dimensional space. Compared with rod-coil diblock copolymers with
the anchor point positioned at one end, the copolymers with the anchor
point at the middle of the rod exhibit significantly different phase
behaviors. When the rod volume fraction is low, the steric hindrance of
the lateral coils prevents the rods stacking into strip or micelle as
that in rod-coil diblock copolymers. The competition between interfacial
energy and entropy results in the formation of lamellar structures and
the increasing thickness of the lamellar layer with increasing rod
volume fraction. When the rod volume fraction is high, the graft density
of the planar interface is decreased, which results in space-filling
requirements and stretching penalty, thus leading to the stability of
nonlamellar structures with curing interface. Furthermore, our results
also suggest that the effect of the chain architecture on the
self-assembled behavior is remarkable when the rod volume fraction is
low, whereas the effect is weak when the rod volume fraction is high.
