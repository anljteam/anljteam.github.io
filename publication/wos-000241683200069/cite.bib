 abstract = {The resin transfer molding has gained popularity in the preparation of
fiber-reinforced polymer-matrix composites because of its high
efficiency and low pollution. The non-uniform inter-tow and intra-tow
flows are regarded as the reason of void formation in RTM. According to
the process characteristics, the axisymmetric model was developed to
study the interaction between the flow in the inter-tow space and that
in the intra-tow space. The flow behavior inside the fiber tows was
formulated using Brinkman's equation, while that in the open space
around the fiber tows was formulated by Stokes' equation. The volume of
fluid (VOF) method was applied to track the flow front, and the effects
of filling velocity, resin viscosity, inter-tow dimension and intra-tow
permeability on fluid pressure and flow front were analyzed. The results
show that the flow front difference between the inter-tow and intra-tow
becomes larger with the decrease of intra-tow permeability, as well as
the increase of filling velocity and inter-tow dimension. (c) 2006
