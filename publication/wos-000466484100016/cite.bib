 abstract = {During development, the precise implementation of molecular programs is
a key determinant of proper dendritic development. Here, we demonstrate
that canonical Wnt signaling is active in dendritic bundle-forming layer
II pyramidal neurons of the rat retrosplenial cortex during dendritic
branching and spine formation. Transient downregulation of canonical Wnt
transcriptional activity during the early postnatal period irreversibly
reduces dendritic arbor architecture, leading to long-lasting deficits
in spatial exploration and/or navigation and spatial memory in the
adult. During the late phase of dendritogenesis, canonical Wnt-dependent
transcription regulates spine formation and maturation. We identify
neuro-trophin-3 as canonical Wnt target gene in regulating
dendritogenesis. Our findings demonstrate how temporary imbalance in
canonical Wnt signaling during specific time windows can result in
irreversible dendritic defects, leading to abnormal behavior in the
adult.},
