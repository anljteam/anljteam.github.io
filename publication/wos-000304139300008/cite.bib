 abstract = {The time- and temperature-related crystallization process for the
structure transitions of asymmetric crystalline-crystalline diblock
copolymers from the melt to crystallites was investigated with
synchrotron simultaneous small-angle/wide-angle X-ray scattering. Two
asymmetric poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(e-caprolactone) diblock copolymers
were chosen. It is found in the course of the copolymer crystallization
that the shorter blocks are uncrystallizable in both of the asymmetric
diblock copolymers and final lamellar structures are formed in both of
them. The final lamellar structure was confirmed from atomic force
microscopy observations. The small-angle X-ray scattering data collected
were analyzed with different methods for the early stage of
crystallization. Guinier and Debye-Bueche plots indicate that there are
neither isolated domains nor correlated domains formed before the
formation of lamellae in the asymmetric diblock copolymers during the
crystallization process. The structure evolution was calculated
according to the correlation function, and the soft nanoconfined
crystallization behavior is discussed. Copyright (C) 2012 Society of
