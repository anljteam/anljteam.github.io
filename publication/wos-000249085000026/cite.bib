 abstract = {Synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering was used to study the
deformation mechanism of high-density polyethylene that was stretched
beyond the natural draw ratio. New insight into the cooperative
deformational behavior being mediated via slippage of micro-fibrils was
gained. The scattering data confirm on the one hand the model proposed
by Peterlin on the static structure of oriented polyethylene being
composed of oriented fibrils, which are built by bundles of
micro-fibrils. On the other hand it was found that deformation is
mediated by the slippage of the micro-fibrils and not the slippage of
the fibrils. In the micro-fibrils, the polymer chains are highly
oriented both in the crystalline and in the amorphous regions. When
stretching beyond the natural draw ratio mainly slippage of
micro-fibrils past each other takes place. The thickness of the
interlamellar amorphous layers increases only slightly. The coupling
force between micro-fibrils increases during stretching due to
inter-microfibrillar polymer segments being stretched taut thus
increasingly impeding further sliding of the micro-fibrils leading
finally to slippage of the fibrils. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights
