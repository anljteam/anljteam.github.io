 abstract = {We investigated the dependence of the dewetting velocity of a thin,
low-viscosity polystyrene (PS) top film on a poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA) double layer consisting of a low-viscosity underlayer of
thickness h(L) coated with a high-viscosity middle layer of thickness
h(M). The addition of the liquid underlayer generated complex
nonmonotonic behavior of the dewetting velocity as a function of
increasing h(M). In particular, we observed an acceleration of dewetting
for an intermediate range of h(M). This phenomenon has been interpreted
by a combination deformation of the middle elastic layer and a
concurrent change in the contact angle. On one hand, deformation led to
the formation of a trench that dissipated energy during its movement
through the liquid underlayer and thus caused a slowing down of
dewetting. However, with an increase in the thickness of the elastic
middle layer, the size of the trench decreased and its influence on the
dewetting velocity also decreased. On the other hand, the deformation of
the elastic layer also led to an increase in the contact angle. This
increase in the driving capillary forces caused an increase in the
dewetting velocity.},
