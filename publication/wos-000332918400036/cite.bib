 abstract = {We investigated the effect of silica nanoparticle loading, dispersed
phase fraction and shear rate on the arrested coalescence in immiscible
blends of polybutadiene/polydimethylsiloxane (PBD/PDMS) under simple
shear flow by an online optical-shear system. It was found that the size
and regularity of the non-spherical PBD droplets resulted from arrested
coalescence were determined by SiO2 nanoparticles loading, dispersed
phase fraction and shear rate. At low SiO2 nanoparticle loading or high
dispersed phase fractions, the coalescence of PBD droplets induced at
low shear rate can be arrested by the nanoparticles at the interface,
leading to the formation of large and irregular droplets. Increasing
SiO2 nanoparticles loading, decreasing dispersed phase fraction or
increasing shear rate can greatly decrease the size of the PBD droplets
and improve their regularity. The results should be closely related to
SiO2 nanoparticles coverage at the interface of the PBD droplets.},
