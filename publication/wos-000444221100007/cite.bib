 abstract = {Stenotrophomonas maltophilia as one of increasing food spoilage bacteria
and fish pathogens has become a threat to aquiculture industry. A major
factor contributing to the success of bacterium is its outstanding
ability to secrete protease at low temperatures. Here, a cAMP receptor
like protein (Clp) shows a positive regulation on this protease, named
S. maltophilia temperature-response protease (SmtP). Interestingly, a
two-component system, comprising of LotS sensor and LotR regulator, for
low-temperature response is also confirmed to modulate SmtP expression
with similar effect to Clp. Evidence is presented that LotS/LotR
modulates smtP (coding SmtP) expression via Clp: clp promoter activity
was reduced significantly at low temperatures and protease activity was
partially restored by Clp overexpressed in /otS or lotR deletion strain.
Furthermore, as a Clp negative effector, the binding ability of c-di-GMP
with Clp is not impacted by temperature. c-di-GMP level was increased in
S. maltophilia growing at high temperature, but not exhibited
significantly in lotR deleted strain, these indicate that LotR is
required for temperature modulating c-di-GMP level, although the
synthesis or degradation activity of c-di-GMP by LotR was not detected.
These findings suggest that LotS/LotR/Clp play an important role in
responding to temperature stimuli via c-di-GMP mediated manner.},
