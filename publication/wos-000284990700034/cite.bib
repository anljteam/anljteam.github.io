 abstract = {Self-assembly of symmetric ABC three-arm star copolymers confined in
cylindrical nanopores is investigated by means of a lattice Monte Carlo
simulation method. The dependence of morphologies on the degree of
confinement and preference of pore surface is studied systematically.
For the symmetric ABC three-arm star copolymers which form polygonal
cylinder structures with periodic spacing L-0 in bulk, various novel
structures are observed inside the nanopores. In the nanopores with a
neutral surface, we find a minimum diameter value (D-min approximate to
L-0) under which helical arranged droplets are formed; otherwise,
parallel polygonal cylinder structures are identified. By adjusting the
preference between component A and the pore surfaces, a number of novel
structures such as A cylinder + BC single-strand helix and complex
multilayer double helices are identified. Additionally, the
confinement-induced morphology transition is interpreted by the
frustration parameter D/L-0.},
