 abstract = {Structures of polymers depend on the degree of polymerization and chain
conformation, and the chain conformation plays a key role on the
structure formation and structure transition of an existing polymer,
especially for the crystalline polymers. DSC and WAXD measurements were
performed to investigate crystallization behavior and structure of
polylactide (PLA) with different thermal histories. A similar Mpemba
effect was found during the crystallization process, which showed that
the PLA sample quenched from ``hot″ crystallizes faster than that
quenched from the ``cold″. The obtained crystallization half-times of
isothermal crystallization, and the crystallization temperatures, glass
transition temperatures, and melting points during the cold
nonisothermal crystallization process with a high heating rate, decrease
with holding temperature. The Mpempa effect was discussed and attributed
to the temperature dependent chain conformation or local structure of
the amorphous and confined effect on the conformation adjustment before
PLA crystallization. The unusual crystallization phenomenon of PLA would
be helpful to understand the polymer crystallization and control the
crystalline structure of PLA.},
