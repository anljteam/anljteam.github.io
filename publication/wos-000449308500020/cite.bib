 abstract = {Using our recently proposed method to obtain salt and ion
polarizabilities in aqueous solutions, we determine the polarizabilities
of five salts (LiCl, NaCl, NaBr, KBr, and MgSO4) in water-acetonitrile,
water-ethanol, and water-acetone solutions at eight different
water-organic solvent compositions at the D-line of sodium (589.3 +/-
0.1 nm). Setting Li+ as the reference ion, we determine the ion
polarizabilities of Na+, Cl-, and Br- in binary liquid mixtures. Our
results show that cation polarizability is nearly unaffected by solvent
composition, but anion polarizability exhibits a nonmonotonic behavior
with increasing mole fraction of the organic component in the liquid
mixture. This suggests that ion polarizability in a solution is affected
by the solvent. The results of salt and ion polarizabilities can be used
as important reference data for physical chemistry, atmospheric science,
and biophysics.},
