 abstract = {Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) mechanism, also called mRNA surveillance,
is a universal mRNA degradation pathway in eukaryotes. Hundreds of genes
can be regulated by NMD whether in single-celled or higher organisms.
There have been many studies on NMD and NMD factors (Upf proteins) with
regard to their crucial roles in mRNA decay, especially in mammals and
yeast. However, research focusing on NMD in plant is still lacking
compared to the research that has been dedicated to NMD in mammals and
yeast. Even so, recent study has shown that NMD factors in Arabidopsis
can provide resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses. This
discovery and its associated developments have given plant NMD mechanism
a new outlook and since then, more and more research has focused on this
area. In this review, we focused mainly on the distinctive NMD
micromechanism and functions of Upf proteins in plant with references to
the role of mRNA surveillance in mammals and yeast. We also highlighted
recent insights into the roles of premature termination codon location,
trans-elements and functions of other NMD factors to emphasize the
particularity of plant NMD. Furthermore, we also discussed conventional
approaches and neoteric methods used in plant NMD researches.},
