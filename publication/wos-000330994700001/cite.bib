 abstract = {The calcineurin B-like protein-CBL-interacting protein kinase (CBL-CIPK)
signaling pathway in plants is a Ca2+-related pathway that responds
strongly to both abiotic and biotic environmental stimuli. The CBL-CIPK
system shows variety, specificity, and complexity in response to
different stresses, and the CBL-CIPK signaling pathway is regulated by
complex mechanisms in plant cells. As a plant-specific Ca2+ sensor
relaying pathway, the CBL-CIPK pathway has some crosstalk with other
signaling pathways. In addition, research has shown that there is
crosstalk between the CBL-CIPK pathway and the low-K+ response pathway,
the ABA signaling pathway, the nitrate sensing and signaling pathway,
and others. In this paper, we summarize and review research discoveries
on the CBL-CIPK network. We focus on the different modification and
regulation mechanisms (phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, dual lipid
modification) of the CBL-CIPK network, the expression patterns and
functions of CBL-CIPK network genes, the responses of this network to
abiotic stresses, and its crosstalk with other signaling pathways. We
also discuss the technical research methods used to analyze the CBL-CIPK
network and some of its newly discovered functions in plants.},
