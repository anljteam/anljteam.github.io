 abstract = {Based on lattice model Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to
investigate the influence of channel confinement on the properties of
entangled (Linear-250) and disentangled (Linear-30) linear polymers with
different sizes of channel. It is found that the molecular size of both
Linear-30 and Linear-250 monotonously decreases with decreasing the
channel size, i.e. channel confinement has similar influence on the
static properties of linear chains whether they are entangled or not. As
for the dynamical properties, the diffusion coefficient of Linear-30
decreases with decreasing channel size; while that of Linear-250 first
increases and then decreases, which implies that the confinement will
help to untangle the linear chains. Furthermore, the single target ring
(which can be regarded as a test chain) in the matrix of confined
Linear-30 and Linear-250 systems is also studied. The static properties
of the target ring do not show clear change for these two systems;
however, the diffusion coefficients of Z direction of ring in the
entangled linear matrix show great difference from that of the
disentangled one. This is a further evidence for the untangle effect of
confinement.},
