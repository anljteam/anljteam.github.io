 abstract = {Hyperhydricity (HH) often occurs in plant tissue culture, seriously
influencing the commercial micropropagation and genetic improvement. DNA
methylation has been studied for its function in plant development and
stress responses. However, its potential role in HH is unknown. In this
study, we report the first comparative DNA methylome analysis of normal
and hyperhydric Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. seedlings using
whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq). We found that the global
methylation level decreased in hyperhydric seedlings, and most of the
differentially methylated genes were CHH hypomethylated genes. Moreover,
the bisulfite sequencing results showed that hyperhydric seedlings
displayed CHH demethylation patterns in the promoter of the ACS1 and
ETR1 genes, resulting in upregulated expression of both genes and
increased ethylene accumulation. Furthermore, hyperhydric seedling
displayed reduced stomatal aperture accompanied by decreased water loss
and increased phosphorylation of aquaporins accompanied by increased
water uptake. While silver nitrate (AgNO3) prevented HH by maintained
the degree of methylation in the promoter regions of ACS1 and ETR1 and
downregulated the transcription of both genes. AgNO3 also reduced the
content of ethylene together with the phosphorylation of aquaporins and
water uptake. Taken together, this study suggested that DNA
demethylation is a key switch that activates ethylene pathway genes to
enable ethylene synthesis and signal transduction, which may
subsequently influence aquaporin phosphorylation and stomatal aperture,
eventually causing HH; thus, DNA demethylation plays a crucial role in
HH. These results provide insights into the epigenetic regulation
mechanism of HH and confirm the role of ethylene and AgNO3 in
hyperhydricity control.},
