 abstract = {We study micelles formed by the coil-comb block copolymer, A-b-(A-g-B),
in a B-selective solvent, S. The equilibrium distribution of micelles is
obtained according to the thermodynamics of noninteracting micellar
solutions, with the free energy of a single isolated micelle calculated
using the self-consistent-field theory. Depending on the lengths of the
various blocks and the balance of interactions, two types of micelles of
different sizes and structures call be observed. This is a manifestation
of the competition between two micellar assemblies of the coil-comb
block copolymer at different length scales.},
