 abstract = {The nucleation and growth kinetics of CdS nanocrystals in a two-phase
synthesis system have been investigated. It was found that the
nucleation process is quite lengthy and overlapped with the growth
process; nevertheless, as formed nanocrystals show extremely narrow size
distribution owing to the unique heterogeneous reacting environment and
Ostwald ripening growth. The nucleation and growth kinetics of the
nanocrystals were also influenced strongly by the monomer concentration,
capping agent concentration, and solvent polarity. It was also found
that a high monomer concentration, a low capping agent concentration,
and low solvent polarity lead to a higher maximum nucleus concentration
and nanocrystal concentration, while high polarity solvents are
favorable for the formation of nanocrystals with narrower size
distribution and higher photoluminescence quantum yield.},
