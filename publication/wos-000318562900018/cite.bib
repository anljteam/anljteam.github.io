 abstract = {The isothermally crystallized poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) samples were
obtained at 135 degrees C under pressures (Pc) ranging from 1 bar to 2.5
kbar. The crystalline structures, the structure transition, and thermal
properties of the prepared samples were investigated by wide-angle X-ray
diffraction (WAXD), real time synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering
(SR-SAXS) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) during this
process. The structural parameters, such as the size of crystallites,
the inverse spacing, the long periods and lamellae thicknesses decrease
with pressure increasing. Based on the peculiarities of crystalline
structure and crystallization behaviors, low and high pressure regions
were revealed: disordered alpha crystal was formed in the high pressure
region (>1 kbar). A layer located intermediate between crystalline and
melt-like regions was observed, which finally took on crystalline order.
Reformation, disorder to order transformation, and recrystallization
during heating completely changed the previous crystalline and stacking
structure, a more stable crystalline structure was newly formed. The
melting behaviors of samples indicate the crystalline and stacking
structure formed under high pressure are more stable. Operation of
lateral growth and thickness growth can explain well the influence of
pressure on the structure, stability and the disorder to order
transformation.},
