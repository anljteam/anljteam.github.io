 abstract = {Using molecular dynamics simulation, we investigate the evolution of
chain conformation, stress relaxation, and fracture for a polymer melt
between two walls after step shear. We find that the characteristic
overlap time for the reduced relaxation moduli and the time that the
stretched primitive chain retracts to its equilibrium length are both
much longer than the Rouse time. Importantly, we observe significant
fracture-like flow after shear cessation. While there is considerable
randomness in the location of the fracture plane and the magnitude of
displacement from sample to sample, our analysis suggests that the
randomness is not due to thermal noise, but may reflect inherent
structural and dynamic heterogeneity in the entangled polymer network.},
