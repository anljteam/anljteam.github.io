 abstract = {Using Brownian dynamics simulation, we determine the chain orientation
and stretching and their connection to stress overshoot in an entangled
polymer melt undergoing startup shear at rates lower than the reciprocal
of the Rouse time yet higher than the reciprocal of the reptation time.
In this rate regime, the prevailing tube theory attributes the stress
overshoot to alignment of the primitive chain. In contrast, our results
reveal that there is substantial chain stretching that persists well
beyond the Rouse time, and it contributes significantly to the initial
stress growth. In particular, stress overshoot is found to be primarily
due to chain retraction after considerable stretching rather than chain
orientation.},
