 abstract = {The dewetting behavior of ring polystyrene (RPS) film and linear
polystyrene (LPS) film on silanized Si substrates with different
grafting densities and PDMS substrate was investigated. Results showed
that polymer architectures greatly influenced the dewetting behavior of
the thin polymer film. On the silanized Si substrate with 69% grafting
density, RPS chains exhibited stronger adsorption compared with LPS
chains, and as a result the wetting layer formed more easily. For LPS
films, with a decreased annealing temperature, the stability of the
polymer film changed from non-slip dewetting via apparent slip dewetting
to apparently stable. However, for RPS films, the polymer film stability
switched from apparent slip dewetting to apparently stable. On the
silanized Si substrate with 94% grafting density, the chain adsorption
became weaker and the dewetting processes were faster than that on the
substrate with 69% grafting density at the same experimental
temperature for both the LPS and RPS films. Moreover, on the PDMS
substrate, LPS films always showed non-slip dewetting, while the
dewetting kinetics of RPS films switched from non-slip dewetting to slip
dewetting behaviour. Forming the wetting layer strongly influenced the
stability and dewetting behavior of the thin polymer films.},
