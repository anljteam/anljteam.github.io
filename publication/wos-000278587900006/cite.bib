 abstract = {The intrinsic viscosity of dendrimers in solution shows several
anomalous behaviors that have hitherto not been explained within the
existing theoretical frameworks of either Zimm or Rouse. Here we propose
a simple two-zone model based on the radial segmental density profile of
the dendrimers and combine a non-draining core with a free-draining
outer region description, to arrive at a simple formula that captures
most of the main features in the intrinsic viscosity data obtained in
experiments.},
