 abstract = {Self-assembled behavior of rod-terminally tethered three-armed
star-shaped coil block copolymer melts was studied by applying
self-consistent-field lattice techniques in three-dimensional (3D)
space. Similar to rod-coil diblock copolymers, five morphologies were
observed, i.e., lamellar, perforated lamellar, gyroidlike, cylindrical
and sphericallike structures, while the distribution of the morphologies
in the phase diagram was dramatically changed with respect to that Of
rod-coil diblock copolymers. The perforated lamella was replaced by the
cylinder when f(rod) = 0.45, and the lamella was replaced by the
perforated lamella when f(rod) = 0.5 when the arms A(1) and A(2) had an
equal length and the volume fraction of A(3) arm was low enough.
Simulations were also performed when the arms A(1) and A(2) had unequal
lengths. These results demonstrate that simple branching in the coil
induces interesting microphase transitions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All
