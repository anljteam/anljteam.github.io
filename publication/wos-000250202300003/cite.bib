 abstract = {The gel effect in the reactive extrusion process for free radical
polymerization in a closely intermeshing co-rotating twin screw extruder
was investigated. First the reaction kinetic model was constructed
mainly on the basis of entanglement theory. Next, numerical calculation
expressions for the initiator and monomer concentrations, monomer
conversion, average molecular weight and apparent viscosity were
deduced. Finally, the evolution of the above variables were shown and
discussed for the example of butyl methacrylate. The simulated results
of the monomer conversion are in good agreement with experimental
results.},
