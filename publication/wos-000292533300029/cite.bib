 abstract = {Shear effect on crystal structure, morphology and melting behavior of
poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) were investigated by wide-angle X-ray diffraction
(WAXD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and in-situ polarized
optical microscope (POM). Influences of steady shear on PLLA melt was
investigated during annealing. The impacts of crystallization
temperature (T-c) and shear rate (SR) on crystal structure, crystal
growth rate, nucleation, and melting behavior were studied. It could be
clarified into the low (<20 s(-1)) and high shear rate ranges in terms
of the crystal structure, growth rate, nucleation and melting behavior.
It was found that phase transition and recrystallization during heating
completely changed the stack structure. A new stable structure was
established after a temperature jump in the melting range. Cylindric
morphology arranged with spherulite was also observed in the polymer
films at high T-c influenced by shear effect. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All
