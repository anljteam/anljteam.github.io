 abstract = {Hyperhydricity symptoms are common and significant during the in vitro
culture of Dianthus chinensis L. and greatly affect the micropropagation
and regeneration of cultured plantlets. However, effective measures for
preventing such abnormalities have not been developed for this species.
Silver nitrate (AgNO3) has been shown to revert hyperhydric plantlets to
a normal state. Nevertheless, the effect of AgNO3 on the prevention of
hyperhydricity and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the
present study, 98.7% of the Dianthus chinensis L. plantlets cultured in
a hyperhydricity induction medium (HIM) developed symptoms of
hyperhydricity; however, hyperhydricity symptoms were inhibited to
different degrees when D. chinensis L. plantlets were cultured in HIM
supplemented with various concentrations of AgNO3. In particular,
approximately 97% of the D. chinensis L. plantlets grew normally and
did not show any symptoms of hyperhydricity when cultured in HIM
supplemented with 30 mu mol L-1 AgNO3. Compared with the plantlets
cultured in HIM alone, the plantlets cultured in HIM containing AgNO3
displayed dramatic decreases in water content, ethylene content, and
reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (particularly regarding H2O2
accumulation in guard cells) and showed increased antioxidant enzyme
activity, stoma aperture, and water loss. These changes not only
prevented excess water from accumulating in the tissues of plantlets but
also improved the antioxidant capacity of plantlets, ultimately
resulting in the prevention of hyperhydricity.},
