 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Blueberry juice is a common drink for relieving fatigue, but
its mechanisms of action are unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to validate changes in the dopaminergic
system, especially changes in dopamine transporter (DAT) levels, in a
fatigued state and assess whether such fatigue-related changes can be
ameliorated by blueberry juice.
METHODS: We investigated the expression of striatal DAT and tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH) in mice subjected to a forced swimming fatigue task and
subsequently administered blueberry juice (anthocyanin), caffeine, or
Red Bull (caffeine + taurine) to assess DAT and TH changes in the
nigrostriatal pathway related with fatigue as well as their relief.
RESULTS: Striatal DAT and TH expression was downregulated by fatigue and
upregulated by treatment with blueberry juice, caffeine, and Red Bull.
In addition, DAT and TH expression exhibited positive correlations with
fatigue-related motor performance.
CONCLUSIONS: We provided evidence of compensatory responses of striatal
DAT and TH in the fatigued state, and treatments to relieve fatigue
might upregulate the expression of both striatal DAT and TH. Moreover,
small amounts of blueberry juice exerted similar effects as large
amounts, suggesting that anthocyanin has relatively strong anti-fatigue
effects.},
