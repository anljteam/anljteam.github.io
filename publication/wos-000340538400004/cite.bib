 abstract = {We employ Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the interaction between
an adsorbing linear flexible cationic polyelectrolyte and a ternary
mixed fluid membrane containing neutral (phosphatidylcholine, PC),
monovalent (phosphatidylserine, PS), and multivalent
(phosphatidylinositol, PIP2) anionic lipids. We systematically explore
the influences of polyelectrolyte chain length, polyelectrolyte charge
density, polyelectrolyte total charge amount, and salt solution ionic
strength on the static and dynamic properties of different anionic lipid
species. Our results show that the multivalent PIP2 lipids dominate the
polyelectrolyte-membrane interaction and competitively inhibit
polyelectrolyte-PS binding. When the total charge amount of the
polyelectrolyte is less than that of the local oppositely charged PIP2
lipids, the polyelectrolyte can drag the bound multivalent lipids to
diffuse on the membrane, but cannot interact with the PS lipids. Under
this condition, the diffusion behaviors of the polyelectrolyte closely
follow the prediction of the Rouse model, and the polyelectrolyte chain
properties determine the adsorption amount, concentration gradients, and
hierarchical mobility of the bound PIP2 lipids. However, when the total
charge amount of the polyelectrolyte is larger than that of the local
PIP2 lipids, the polyelectrolyte further binds the PS lipids around the
polyelectrolyte-PIP2 complex to achieve local electrical neutrality. In
this condition, parts of the polyelectrolyte desorb from the membrane
and show faster mobility, and the bound PS presents much faster mobility
than the segregated PIP2. This work provides an explanation for
heterogeneity formation in different anionic lipids induced by
polyelectrolyte adsorption.},
