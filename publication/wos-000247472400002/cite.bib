 abstract = {An attempt was made to explore the genotyping of Trichophyton rubrum (T.
rubrum) and the relationship between genotype and geographical origin
using ribosomal restriction endonuclease polymorphic analysis. The total
DNA was extracted by cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB). The probe
was amplified from part of the 18S, ITSI, 5.8S, and ITSII region of T.
rubrum standard strain with the universal fungal primers NS5 [5'-AACTT
AAAGG AATTG ACGGA AG-3'] and ITS4 [5'-TCCTC CGCTT ATTGA TATGC-3']. The
genomic DNA of 49 clinical T. rubrum isolates digested by EcoR1 were
hybridized with this probe, and the hybridization patterns were used as
the basis of genotyping. Of the data from 49 strains of T. rubrum
studied (21 from Nanjing, 26 from Dalian, and two from Beijing), 20
individual patterns (DNA Type A-T) were identified, among which Type A-C
accounted for 48.98% of all the strains. The DNA patterns of Nanjing
strains were represented by three bands, those of Dalian strains were
represented by four bands. The DNA typing of T. rubrum by Southern
blotting was highly sensitive and highly distinguishable. The DNA
patterns of Nanjing strains were obviously different from those of
Dalian strains.},
