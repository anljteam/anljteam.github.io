 abstract = {Self-assembly of poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) in thin films induced by
chloroform micro-evaporation was investigated by microscopic techniques
and X-ray diffraction studies. A film-thickness dependent on highly
ordered structures has been derived from disordered films. Ring-banded
spherulitic and dendritic morphologies with radial periodic variation of
thicknesses were formed in dilute solution driven by micro-evaporation
of the solvent. Bunched morphologies stacked with a flat-on
lozenge-shaped lamellae were created in thinner films. The formation of
the concentric ring banded structures was attributed to the periodic
rhythmic growth associated with radial periodic changes in the
concentration gradient of PLLA. A diffusion-induced rhythmic growth
mechanism was proposed to explain the formation of the ring banded
morphologies with periodic variation of thicknesses.},
