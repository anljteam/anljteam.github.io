 abstract = {The micellization behaviour of ring-like AB diblock copolymers in a
selective solvent was compared with the corresponding linear ABA
triblock copolymers via Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation results
show that the difference in the critical micellization concentration
(cmc) values between ring-like copolymers and linear copolymers with
same compositions is closely related to the content of A blocks, f(A),
and the strength of attractive interaction between B monomers, epsilon.
When fA is relatively small and e is big, the cmc values of ring-like
block copolymers are smaller than those of the corresponding linear
ones; whereas when fA is big and e is small, the cmc values of triblock
copolymers are smaller than those of the corresponding ring-like ones.
To further understand the effect of fA and e on the micellization
behavior, we calculated the entropy and the potential energy
contributions to the micellization free energy, respectively. The
results show that in the studied range of fA and 8, the entropy loss in
micellization for ring-like block copolymers is always smaller than that
for triblock copolymers, so it seems that the micellization of ring-like
block copolymers is always easier than that of the linear ones if we
only consider the entropy contributions to the free energy. But if we
calculate the potential energy contributions to the free energy, it can
be found when fA is relatively small and 8 is big, the potential energy
decreases greatly during the micellization of ring-like block
copolymers. Considering the less unfavorable contribution of entropy
part to the free energy for ring-like block copolymers, the
micellization of ring-like block copolymers should be much easier than
that of the linear ones. When f(A), is big and e is small, the potential
energy decreases greatly when the micelles form for linear block
copolymers. Although the entropic contribution to the free energy is
unfavorable for linear ones, the potential energy still shows the
dominative contribution to the free energy and therefore the
micellization of linear block copolymers is much easier than the
ring-like ones. The above analysis of the free energy will help us
understand the micellization behavior of ring-like block copolymers and
linear block copolymers.},
