 abstract = {The presence of selectable marker genes and vector backbone sequences
has affected the safe assessment of transgenic plants. In this study,
the ovary-drip method for directly generating vector- and selectable
marker-free transgenic plants was described, by which maize was
transformed with a linear GFP cassette (Ubi-GFP-nos). The key features
of this method center on the complete removal of the styles and the
subsequent application of a DNA solution directly to the ovaries. The
movement of the exogenous DNA was monitored using fluorescein
isothiocyanate-labeled DNA, which showed that the time taken by the
exogenous DNA to enter the ovaries was shortened compared to that of the
pollen-tube pathway. This led to an improved transformation frequency of
3.38% compared to 0.86% for the pollen-tube pathway as determined by
PCR analysis. The use of 0.05% surfactant Silwet L-77 + 5% sucrose as
a transformation solution further increased the transformation frequency
to 6.47%. Southern blot analysis showed that the transgenic plants had
low transgene copy number and simple integration pattern. Green
fluorescence was observed in roots and immature embryos of transgenic
plants by fluorescence microscopy. Progeny analysis showed that GFP
insertions were inherited in T-1 generation. The ovary-drip method would
become a favorable choice for directly generating vector- and
marker-free transgenic maize expressing functional genes of agronomic
interest.},
