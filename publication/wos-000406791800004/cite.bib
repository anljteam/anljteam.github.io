 abstract = {In this paper, a new shape automatic clustering method based on
multi-objective optimization with decomposition (MOEA/D-SAC) is
proposed, which aims to find the final cluster number k as well as an
optimal clustering result for the shape datasets. Firstly, an improved
shape descriptor based on the shape context is proposed to measure the
distance between shapes. Secondly, the diffusion process is applied to
transform the similarity distance matrix among total shapes of a dataset
into a weighted graph, where the shapes and their distance are regarded
as nodes and weight of edges, respectively. Thirdly, a new clustering
method called ``the soft clusteringâ€³ is devised, starting with
constructing an adjacency graph which can maintain the edges with the
weights of k-nearest-neighbor nodes. Then, a multi-objective
evolutionary algorithm with decomposition (MOEA/D) is applied to achieve
automatic graph clustering scheme. The proposed clustering algorithm has
been used to cluster several shape datasets, including four kimia
datasets and a well-known MPEG-7 dataset, and experimental results show
that the proposed method can demonstrate competitive clustering results.},
