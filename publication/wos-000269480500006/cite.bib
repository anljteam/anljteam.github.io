 abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate whether catalpol could
facilitate recovery from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cognitive
deficits and protect brain mitochondrial function from LPS-induced acute
systemic inflammation. In the study, except control group, mice were
challenged with a single dose of LPS (100 mu g/mouse, i.p.) to mimic an
acute peripheral infection. The results showed that LPS enhanced nuclear
factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation and induced a loss in
mitochondrial integrity as shown by a significant decrease in membrane
potential and increase in mitochondrial permeability transition pore
opening. Pretreatment with catalpol (10 mg/kg d, i.p.) for 10 d before
injection of LPS reversed the memory deficits induced by LPS, protected
brain mitochondrial function, and attenuated LPS-induced NF-kappa B
activation. Taken together, these data indicate that catalpol may
possess therapeutic potential against LPS-induced acute systemic
inflammation by attenuating NF-kappa B activation and protecting
mitochondrial function in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. (C) 2008
