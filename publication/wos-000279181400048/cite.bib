 abstract = {Self-assembly of linear ABC coil-coil-rod triblock copolymer melt is
studied by applying self-consistent-field lattice techniques in
three-dimensional (3D) space. In contrast to rod-coil diblock
copolymers, our results reveal the effect of the broad parameter space
on the self-assembly of the linear ABC coil-coil-rod triblock
copolymers. Seven stable structures are found stable, including
``two-color″ lamella, ``three-color″ lamella,
``two-color″-perforated lamella, ``three-color″-perforated
lamella, core-shell hexagonal lattice phase, strip, and micelle. When
the two coil blocks have equal lengths (f(A) = f(B)), the lamellar
structure dominates the majority of the phase diagram. The effects of
the two coil blocks on the self-assembly are explored by tuning the
relative length of the A and B coil blocks in terms of keeping the
length of the block C (rod). Moreover, by switching the position of the
blocks B and C, the influence of the block sequencing on the
self-assembly is studied. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
