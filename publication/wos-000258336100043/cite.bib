 abstract = {The phase behavior of symmetric ABA triblock copolymers containing a
semiflexible midblock is studied by lattice Monte Carlo simulation. As
the midblock evolves from a fully flexible state to a semiflexible state
in terms of increase in its persistence length, different phase
behaviors are observed while cooling the system from an infinite high
temperature to a temperature below T-ODT (order-disorder transition
temperature). Within the midblock flexibility range we studied (l(p)/N-c
<= 0.105), a lamellar structure is formed at equilibrium state as the
situation for fully flexible chains. The fraction of bridge chain is
evaluated for the lamellar structures. We find that the increase in
midblock rigidity indeed results in the increase in bridge chain
fraction within the range from 44.9% to 51.8%. In order to elucidate
phase behavior evolution observed in our simulation, a detailed
conformation distribution analysis is also given. Our results bridge a
gap of different phase behaviors between rod-coil block copolymer and
coil-coil block copolymer and show a necessity to investigate rigidity
influence on phase diagram. (C) 2008 American Institute of Physics.},
