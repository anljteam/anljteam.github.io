 abstract = {Polyelectrolyte hydrogel is a ternary mixture of water, polymer network
and mobile ions. The present paper examined two popular models
describing the swelling and deformation behaviors of polyelectrolyte
hydrogels, i.e. the multiphasic model and the transport model. The water
flow, the network deformation and the ionic diffusion are coupled in the
multiphasic model, and the gradient of the fluid pressure is taken as
the driving force for the network deformation. However, the water flow
is neglected in the transport model with the ionic osmotic pressure
taking the role of fluid pressure. Two simplified experiments, i.e. the
free swelling of a hydrogel sphere in response to the concentration
change of the external salt solution and the bending deformation of a
hydrogel strip under an external electric field, are simulated by the
two models. Simulation shows that the two models lead to the same
predictions for the swelling equilibrium of the hydrogel sphere but
different predictions for the swelling kinetics of the hydrogel sphere
and the deformation of the hydrogel strip under the external electric
field. These are due to the fact that the two models are equivalent in
thermodynamic equilibrium situations, but in thermodynamic
non-equilibrium situations, the transport model is no longer applicable
as it neglects the water flow in the hydrogel and takes the ionic
osmotic pressure as a mechanical parameter to play the role of swelling
pressure. The present work will be helpful for understanding the
hydrodynamics of polyelectrolyte hydrogels and the application of the
two models. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
