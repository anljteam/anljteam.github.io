 abstract = {Background of the study - Salt damage has recently become a serious
problem worldwide. Though ammonium-N is widely used as the main N source
for growth of blueberry, few studies on ammonium damage to blueberry
were reported. Objectives - The current research aimed to explore the
effects of ammonium stress and supplemental calcium on blueberry growth
using an in vitro model. Methods - In vitro cultured blueberry plantlets
subjected to 1/4 MS itself containing 0.005M NH4+, 1/4 MS containing
0.01M NH4+, 1/4 MS containing 0.02M NH4+, 1/4 MS containing 0.02M NH4+
plus 0.01M Ca2+. Plant biomass, nutrient compositions and anti-oxidants
in plantlets were analyzed. Results - Ammonium stress induced by 0.02M
NH4+ significantly inhibited growth of in vitro cultured blueberry.
Plants under ammonium stress showed the highest contents of N and Fe,
and lowest contents of K, Ca, Mg and Mn. Ammonium stress also
significantly inhibited contents of proline (Pro), Methane Dicarboxylic
Aldehyde (MDA), soluble protein (SP) and the activity of superoxide
dismutase (SOD), and promoted the activities of catalase (CAT),
peroxidase (POD) and glutamine synthetase (GS). 0.01M supplemental Ca2+
proved to enhance the growth of blueberry plantlets exposed to ammonium
stress with the obviously increased contents of K, Ca, Mg and Mn, Pro,
MDA, SP and the increased activity of SOD. Close correlations were
observed among plant biomass, nutrient compositions and anti-oxidants in
blueberry plantlets. Conclusions - Ammonium stress affects growth of
blueberry plantlets by regulating the allocation of nutrient composition
and the anti-oxidant activity, which closely correlate with calcium
signaling pathways. Supplemental Ca2+ could prevent ammonium damage. In
vitro culture used as a model provides an effective and promising
approach for study of plant stress, and a powerful technical support for
field management of Vaccinium plants.},
