 abstract = {The scaling behavior of the second virial coefficient of ring polymers
at the theta temperature of the corresponding linear polymer (theta(L))
is investigated by off-lattice Monte Carlo simulations. The effects of
the solvents are modeled by pairwise interaction between polymer
monomers in this approach. Using the umbrella sampling, we calculate the
effective potential U(r) between two ring polymers as well as the second
virial coefficient A(2) of ring polymers at theta(L), which results from
a combination of 3-body interactions and topological constraints. The
trend in the strength of the effective potential with respect to chain
length shows a non-monotonic behavior, differently from that caused only
by topological constraints. Our simulation suggests that there are three
regimes about the scaling behavior of A(2) of ring polymers at
theta(L):3-body interactions dominating regime, the crossover regime,
and the topological constraints dominating regime.},
