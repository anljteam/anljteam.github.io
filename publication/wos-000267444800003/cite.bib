 abstract = {The budded virus (BV) of Antheraea pernyi is a nuclear polyhedrosis
virus (ApNPV), that belongs to the baculovirus family. it is capable of
stimulating innate immune response in avian macrophage-like cells
(HD11). In this study, we used the expression of proinflammatory
cytokines (IFN-gamma and IL-12p40) and production of nitric oxide (NO)
as indicators to evaluate the involvement of the signaling cascades in
the activation of HD11 cells by BV. Western blot analysis revealed that
ERK1/2, p38 MAPK and JNK were phosphorylated followed by activation of
p65-NF-kappa B after HD11 cells were challenged with BV. Inhibition of
p38 MAPK and NF-kappa B by their respective inhibitors abolished
BV-induced expression of IL-12p40, IFN-gamma and production of NO,
whereas inhibition of JNK abolished only the induction of cytokines.
Additionally, inhibition of ERK1/2 resulted in unexpected increases in
both cytokine expression and NO production. Taken together, these
findings indicated that in BV-induced HD11 cells, the induction of
cytokines was mediated by the p38 MAPK, JNK and NF-kappa B pathways, and
NO production was mediated through the p38 MAPK/NF-kappa B pathways. (C)
