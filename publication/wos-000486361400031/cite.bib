 abstract = {Polymer crystallization is crucial to the properties of polymers, which
are determined by thermal dynamics and kinetics. The formation of
polymorphism has turned out to be very important for applications of
poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA), because it has evolved into a competitive
commodity material over the past decade. In the in situ wide-angle X-ray
scattering study, it shows the growth of alpha-crystal of thermally
treated PLLA at T-c = 80 and 90 degrees C, which was considered only
appropriate for the crystallization of its delta-form. A part of
alpha-embryos and the locally ordered structures developed for the
alpha-crystal may adjust their chain conformations from getting adapted
to the crystallization of the delta-crystal, while the others continue
to grow in their own alpha-form. Two crystal forms crystallize on
different dynamic pathways, and the delta-form should be an independent
crystal, better identified as the ``delta-″ instead of the previous
``alpha'-″.},
