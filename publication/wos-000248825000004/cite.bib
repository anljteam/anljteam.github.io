 abstract = {A novel neurotoxic protein phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)), molecular weight
13 881.83 Da, has been isolated from snake venom of Gloydius
ussuriensis, named as Gln49-PLA(2), which shows weak lethal toxic,
myotoxic and apparent anticoagulant activity, but lacks phospholipase
activity. The Gln49-PLA(2) obviously induced an increase of the pain
threshold in intoxicated 615 mice compared with the control group,
suggesting it is a neurotoxin. Hot-plate tests also showed that its
analgesic activity was dose-dependent, and naloxone antagonized the
analgesic effect, implying the mechanism of action of Gln49-sPLA(2) is
correlated with opioid receptors. Electrophysiology studies revealed
decreases in the action potential and the nerve conduction velocity in
isolated hoptoad (Bufo bufo gargarizans Cantor) sciatic nerve,
indicating Gln49-PLA(2) most probably had effects on ion channels.
