 abstract = {The time dependent hierarchical structures and crystallization behaviors
of synthetic crystalline-crystalline symmetric diblock copolymer
poly(ethylene oxide)-b-polylactide (PEO-b-PLLA) were investigated by DSC
and synchrotron simultaneous small-angle/wide-angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS/WAXS) measurements with various isothermal crystallization
conditions. DSC measurements indicated that both blocks can crystallize
and melt independently. Synchrotron SAXS/WAXS results showed that the
structures and crystallization behaviors of PLLA and PEO blocks
influence each other and the crystallization of both blocks could induce
microphase separation into layer-layer structures, however, the
crystalline structures of both blocks are not affected. It is assumed
that the final structure of the crystalline-crystalline block copolymer
is determined by the crystallization behaviors of the blocks rather than
the glass transition temperature of the PLLA block and the theoretical
microphase structure of the block copolymers.},
