 abstract = {Highbush blueberries need sufficient chilling exposure to induce bud
break and flowering, which limits their cultivation in warm areas as
well as the profitability of protected cultivation in greenhouses.
Hydrogen cyanamide (H2CN2, HC), gibberellic acid (GA(3)), ethephon (CE),
mineral oil (MO), and potassium nitrate (KNO3) are often applied to
deciduous fruit trees to advance bud break and fruit set. In this study,
experiments were conducted in northeast China to determine the effects
of different concentrations of HC or HC in combination with GA(3), CE,
MO, and KNO3 on bud break, fruit quality, and fruit yield in
greenhouse-grown highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.). The
results showed that all of the treatment agents could advance bud break
by at least 15 days and fruit ripening by 16 days compared to the
control. In addition, all treatments could promote the development of
flowers and fruits and shorten the flowering and harvest periods.
Compared with the control, 0.5% HC or 0.67% HC treatment increased the
fruit yield of 5-year-old and 7-year-old bushes, especially early yield.
Experiments carried out over two consecutive years in two different
varieties, namely `M7' and `Brigitta', further confirmed the positive
effect of 0.67% HC application on fruit yield. The results also showed
that 0.67% HC had no negative effects on fruit quality. These findings
may encourage growers to consider spraying HC in greenhouses to increase
fruit yield, especially early yield, in order to schedule the harvest
time for a more lucrative marketing period.},
