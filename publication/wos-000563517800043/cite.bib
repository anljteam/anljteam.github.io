 abstract = {K(+)is an essential nutrient for plant growth and is responsible for
many important physiological processes. K(+)deficiency leads to crop
yield losses, and overexpression of K(+)transporter genes has been
proven to be an effective way to resolve this problem. However, current
research on the overexpression of K(+)transporter genes is limited to
plant sources. TrkH is a bacterial K(+)transporter whose function
generally depends on the regulation of TrkA. To date, whether TrkH can
improve K(+)uptake in eukaryotic organisms is still unknown. In this
study, a novelMbtrkHgene was cloned from marine microbial metagenomic
DNA. Functional complementation and K+-depletion analyses revealed that
MbTrkH functions in K(+)uptake in the K+-deficient yeast strain CY162.
Moreover, K+-depletion assays revealed thatMbtrkHoverexpression improves
plant K(+)uptake. K(+)hydroponic culture experiments showed that,
compared with WT tobacco lines,MbtrkHtransgenic tobacco lines had
significantly greater fresh weights, dry weights and K(+)contents. These
results indicate that MbTrkH promotes K(+)uptake independently of TrkA
in eukaryotes and provide a new strategy for improving K+-use efficiency
in plants.},
