 abstract = {Monte Carlo simulation has been used to investigate the effects of
linear solvent molecular size on polymer chain conformation in
solutions. Increasing the solvent molecular size leads to shrinkage of
the polymer chains and increase of the critical overlap concentrations.
The root-mean-square radius of gyration of polymer chains (R-g) is less
sensitive to the variation of polymer concentration in solutions of
larger solvent molecules. In addition, the dependency of R-g on polymer
concentration under normal solvent conditions and solvent molecular size
is in good agreement with scaling laws. When the solvent molecular size
approaches the ideal end-to-end distance of the polymer chain, an extra
aggregation of polymer chains occurs, and the solvent becomes the
so-called medium-sized solvent. When the size of solvent molecules is
smaller than the medium size, the polymer chains are swollen or
partially swollen. However, when the size of solvent molecules is larger
than the medium size, the polymer coils shrink and segregate, enwrapped
by the large solvent molecules. (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics.},
