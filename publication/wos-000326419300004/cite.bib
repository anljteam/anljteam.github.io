 abstract = {Caveolin-1 is involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity, but the
relationship between its expression and cognitive function during aging
remains controversial. To explore the relationship between synaptic
plasticity in the aging process and changes in learning and memory, we
examined caveolin-1 expression in the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum
of rats at different ages. We also examined the relationship between the
expression of caveolin-1 and synaptophysin, a marker of synaptic
plasticity. Hippocampal caveolin-1 and synaptophysin expression in aged
(22-24 month old) rats was significantly lower than that in young (1
month old) and adult (4 months old) rats. Expression levels of both
proteins were significantly greater in the cortex of aged rats than in
that of young or adult rats, and levels were similar between the three
age groups in the cerebellum. Linear regression analysis revealed that
hippocampal expression of synaptophysin was associated with memory and
learning abilities. Moreover, synaptophysin expression correlated
positively with caveolin-1 expression in the hippocampus, cortex and
cerebellum. These results confirm that caveolin-1 has a regulatory
effect on synaptic plasticity, and suggest that the downregulation of
hippocampal caveolin-1 expression causes a decrease in synaptic
plasticity during physiological aging.},
