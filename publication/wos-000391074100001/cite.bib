 abstract = {Hyperhydricity occurs frequently in plant tissue culture and can
severely affect commercial micropropagation and genetic improvement of
the cultured plantlets. Hyperhydric shoots are charaterzized by high
water content, but how this occurs is still a subject of investigation.
Silver ion (Ag+) can reduce the extent of hyperhydricity in plants, but
its effect on the reversion of hyperhydric plantlets and the underlying
mechanism of reversion has not been clarified. In this study, about 67%
of the hyperhydric Dianthus chinensis L. plantlets were found to revert
to normal condition when the plantlets were cultured in medium
supplemented with 29.4 mu mol L-1 AgNO3. Water content and hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2) content in the guard cells of these plantlets were
reduced, while stomatal aperture and water loss rate were increased.
AgNO3 also reduced the content of endogenous ethylene and expression of
ethylene synthesis and ethylene signal transduction-associated genes.
Reduced accumulation of ethylene consequently led to an increase in
stomatal aperture mediated by decreased H2O2 content in the guard cells.
These results adequately verified the role of AgNO3 in the reversion of
hyperhydricity in D. chinensis L. and also provided clues for exploring
the cause of excessive water accumulation in hyperhydric plants. (C)
