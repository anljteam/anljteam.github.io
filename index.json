Most wearable supercapacitors have rigid architecture and lack the capacity for editability into desirable shapes. Through sandwiching hydrogel electrolytes between two electrodes, a suite of wearable supercapacitors that integrate desirable properties namely: repeated shape editability, excellent self-healing capability, and long-term cycling durability is demonstrated. A strategy is proposed to enhance the long-term cycling durability by utilizing hydrogel electrolytes with unique cross-linking structures. The dynamic crosslinking sites are formed by quadruple H bonds and hydrophobic association, stabilizing the supercapacitors from inorganic ion disruption during charge-discharge processes. The fabricated supercapacitors result in the capacitance retention rates of 99.6% and 95.8% after 5000 and 10 000 charge-discharge cycles, respectively, which are much higher than others reported in the literature. Furthermore, the supercapacitor sheets can be repeatedly processed into various shapes without any capacitance loss. The supercapacitors exhibit a 95% capacitance retention rate after five cutting/self-healing cycles, indicative of their excellent self-healing performance. To demonstrate real-life applicability, the wearable supercapacitors are successfully used to power a light-emitting diode and an electronic watch.","tags":["capacitance retention rate; hydrogel electrolytes; long-term cycling durability; shape editability; wearable supercapacitors"],"title":"Self-Healing and Shape-Editable Wearable Supercapacitors Based on Highly Stretchable Hydrogel Electrolytes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H Li","Chen Liu","J Li","W He"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1657066935,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657066935,"objectID":"6fe280701162dd0fed55ddd77470fc21","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/liu-bifunctional/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:22:15.021788Z","relpermalink":"/publication/liu-bifunctional/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Bifunctional Silicon for Cylic Ether Opening Catalyzed by Nanoporous Gold","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J Liu","Chen Liu","W He"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1657066934,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657066934,"objectID":"f5d26c01c593028e2ccac4e1eaae68c7","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/liu-fluorophores/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:22:14.557994Z","relpermalink":"/publication/liu-fluorophores/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Fluorophores and their applications as molecular probes in living cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hongyang Gao","Xiuying Xia","Lijia An"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1654041600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067527,"objectID":"f733fa696abf5de39ef70720304cab28","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000772010200001/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:32:07.072083Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000772010200001/","section":"publication","summary":"Hyperhydricity (HH) often occurs in plant tissue culture, seriously influencing the commercial micropropagation and genetic improvement. DNA methylation has been studied for its function in plant development and stress responses. However, its potential role in HH is unknown. In this study, we report the first comparative DNA methylome analysis of normal and hyperhydric Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. seedlings using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq). We found that the global methylation level decreased in hyperhydric seedlings, and most of the differentially methylated genes were CHH hypomethylated genes. Moreover, the bisulfite sequencing results showed that hyperhydric seedlings displayed CHH demethylation patterns in the promoter of the ACS1 and ETR1 genes, resulting in upregulated expression of both genes and increased ethylene accumulation. Furthermore, hyperhydric seedling displayed reduced stomatal aperture accompanied by decreased water loss and increased phosphorylation of aquaporins accompanied by increased water uptake. While silver nitrate (AgNO3) prevented HH by maintained the degree of methylation in the promoter regions of ACS1 and ETR1 and downregulated the transcription of both genes. AgNO3 also reduced the content of ethylene together with the phosphorylation of aquaporins and water uptake. Taken together, this study suggested that DNA demethylation is a key switch that activates ethylene pathway genes to enable ethylene synthesis and signal transduction, which may subsequently influence aquaporin phosphorylation and stomatal aperture, eventually causing HH; thus, DNA demethylation plays a crucial role in HH. These results provide insights into the epigenetic regulation mechanism of HH and confirm the role of ethylene and AgNO3 in hyperhydricity control.","tags":[],"title":"Critical roles of the activation of ethylene pathway genes mediated by DNA demethylation in Arabidopsis hyperhydricity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Baicheng Mei","Bilin Zhuang","Yuyuan Lu","Lijia An","Zhen-Gang Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1651363200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067527,"objectID":"0e5ca0e24eda6611438f7022e3d4ed48","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000799352500026/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:32:06.600918Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000799352500026/","section":"publication","summary":"Glass formers exhibit a pronounced slowdown in dynamics, accompanied by progressive heterogeneity as they approach the glass transition. There is intense debate over whether the dramatic slowdown is caused by dynamical heterogeneity and whether the enhanced dynamical heterogeneity originates from structural causes. However, the connection between dynamical heterogeneity and the spatial distribution of the single-particle free volume (a purely static structural quantity) was found to be rather weak, which raises the question of whether dynamic heterogeneity has a purely structural origin. Here, by introducing the concept of local-average free volume, we present numerical evidence that long-time dynamic heterogeneity shows significantly enhanced correlation with the average local free volume over a length scale of a few neighboring shells. Our results resolve the long-standing controversy about whether free volume plays an important role in particle rearrangements associated with the activated hopping relaxation. The concept of ``local average″ can be applied to other local structural descriptors to better correlate with dynamic heterogeneity in glass-forming liquids.","tags":[],"title":"Local-Average Free Volume Correlates with Dynamics in Glass Formers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiangyang Mo","Jian Wang","Zhenhua Wang","Yuyuan Lu","Lijia An"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1646092800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067527,"objectID":"1704630697736ebbc0d2b6174a2877f1","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000772188000005/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:32:07.535973Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000772188000005/","section":"publication","summary":"Using dynamic Monte Carlo simulations based on the bond-fluctuation model, we systematically investigate the static and dynamic properties of a tracer ring polymer in a melt composed of linear polymers. Our results reveal that the mean-square radius of gyration of a cyclic polymer is independent of the topological constraints between the ring and linear chains. The scaling exponent (upsilon) of the radius of gyration R-g similar to N-R(upsilon), where N-R is the ring chain length, increases from 0.5 to 0.6 as the length of the linear matrix chains, N-L, decreases, which lies between the two values reported by Iyer et al. [Macromolecules 2007, 40, 5995] and Lang et al. [Macromolecules 2012, 45, 7642]. We find that both the structural relaxation time and self-diffusion coefficient are nearly independent of N-L for a short ring chain (N-R = 20) and the scaling exponents of N-L for the self-diffusion coefficient are between -1 and -2 for large N-R (N-R = 100), which cannot be understood by existing mechanisms, including the restraint reptation mechanism, the once-threaded mechanism, and the constraint release mechanism. Furthermore, we propose a ``touch-threading″ mechanism, which could be regarded as an important supplement to the above mechanisms, to describe the structural relaxation and translational diffusion of a tracer ring in a linear melt. In addition, when N-L is large, the structural relaxation and translational diffusion of the tracer ring are decoupled, resulting in a breakdown of the extended Stokes-Einstein relation. These results provide fundamental insights into the properties of the ring-linear blends.","tags":[],"title":"Size and Dynamics of a Tracer Ring Polymer Embedded in a Linear Polymer Chain Melt Matrix","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qingling Wang","Jianli Guo","Lijia An","Yongming Bao"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1643673600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067528,"objectID":"d7d0a890cdf5df9f488739ff06d57514","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000738732500018/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:32:08.008493Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000738732500018/","section":"publication","summary":"Two-component signal system (TCS) is the predominant bacterial sense-and-response machinery. RpfC/RpfG TCS involved in quorum sensing molecule Diffuse Signal Factor (DSF) signal perception and transduction was well studied in many bacteria.

Here, we showed that RpfC/RpfG could integrate temperature and DSF signal partially controlling the production of the temperature-dependent protease (SmtP) in S. maltophilia FF11, a strain isolated from frozen Antarctic hill, exhibited spoilage potential due to secret more protease at low temperatures involving in protein degradation. qRT-PCR analysis revealed rpf system mediating approximately 60% transcription activity of Clp, a critical transcription factor linking with LotS/LotR, consisting a signal network controlling completely the SmtP production in previous study. Protease production was partially reduced in rpfF (coding DSF synthetase) mutant strains at 15 degrees C or 25 degrees C, not be increased through addition DSF or overexpression RpfF in WT at 37 degrees C, indicating that DSF was effective for protease production only at low temperatures in S. maltophilia. Additionally, biochemical analysis revealed the enzymatic activity of RpfG from strain FF11 cultured at 37 degrees C or DSF-deficient strains grown at 25 degrees C was significantly reduced compared to that of RpfG from strain FF11 cultured at 25 degrees C. These findings outline an interplay mechanism that allows S. maltophilia to integrate quorum sensing and temperature cues controlling protease production, and imply a potential relationship between two distinct systems of RpfC/RpfG and LotS/LotR.","tags":[],"title":"Integration of DSF and Temperature Signals for RpfC/RpfG Two-Component System Modulating Protease Production in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia FF11","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuyuan Lu","Zhenhua Wang","Lijia An","An-Chang Shi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067529,"objectID":"f8753c24f74bbc0ce07e70b95a86d868","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000751672700007/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:32:08.971058Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000751672700007/","section":"publication","summary":"The force- and flow-induced translocation processes of linear and ring polymers are studied using a combination of multiparticle collision dynamics and molecular dynamics, focusing on the behavior of the polymer translocation time. We compare the force- and flowinduced translocations of linear and ring polymers. It is found that when the translocation time (tau*) is characterized by scaling exponents, delta, delta', and alpha, via the relations tau* similar to f(phi)N(alpha) and tau* similar to J(delta)'N-alpha, the scaling exponents are not constants. For long chains tested, alpha = 1.0 for both forceand flow-induced translocations. The difference between the force- and flow-induced translocations stems from different monomer crowding effects due to distinct flow patterns outside the channel. Furthermore, general relations for polymer translocation time are derived for these two translocation processes, which are in good agreement with the simulation results. Our results provide clear molecular pictures for the force- and flow-induced translocations, which shed light on the understanding of translocation dynamics and provide guidance for practical applications such as molecular sequencing and ultrafiltration.","tags":[],"title":"Polymer Translocation Time","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yongjin Ruan","Yuyuan Lu","Lijia An","Zhen-Gang Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067528,"objectID":"1f6115738220b640d98a5ab72739be3b","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000744122100010/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:32:08.492806Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000744122100010/","section":"publication","summary":"Using molecular dynamics simulation, we study shear banding of entangled polymer melts under a steady shear.

Furthermore, for the steady shear bands persisting to the longest simulated time of 9.0 tau(d0) (disengagement time), the shear rate in the slow band and the relative proportion of the bands do not change very much with the increase of imposed shear rate, but the shear rate in the fast band increases approximately in proportion to the imposed shear rates, in contradiction to the lever rule.","tags":[],"title":"Shear Banding in Entangled Polymers: Stress Plateau, Banding Location, and Lever Rule","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaozheng Duan","An-Chang Shi","Lijia An"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1633046400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067529,"objectID":"6092b045b7127cc7c11e9bdb25decea9","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000708701900013/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:32:09.439843Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000708701900013/","section":"publication","summary":"Developing strategies for assembling ionic polymers into nanoaggregates with desired properties confers effective routes for the fabrications of functional materials.

Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we develop a simple, convenient, but novel approach for fabricating large ionomer microparticles in dilute aqueous solutions. We demonstrate that added cationic polyelectrolytes (PEs) could electrostatically bind the dispersed ionomers and trigger their self-assembly into microparticles composed of a hydrophobic core and an anionic shell. The size of the microparticles could be precisely controlled by adjusting the concentration and chain length of the binding PEs. Furthermore, bare microparticles can be obtained through PE desorption in saline solution. We examine the mechanical and thermodynamic stability of the ionomer microparticle and its shape-memory nature in response to external force and temperature. Moreover, our simulations on electrophoresis reveal that a mobility reversal of the microparticles occurs due to overcharging of the binding PE.

Hydrogen cyanamide (H2CN2, HC), gibberellic acid (GA(3)), ethephon (CE), mineral oil (MO), and potassium nitrate (KNO3) are often applied to deciduous fruit trees to advance bud break and fruit set. In this study, experiments were conducted in northeast China to determine the effects of different concentrations of HC or HC in combination with GA(3), CE, MO, and KNO3 on bud break, fruit quality, and fruit yield in greenhouse-grown highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.). The results showed that all of the treatment agents could advance bud break by at least 15 days and fruit ripening by 16 days compared to the control. In addition, all treatments could promote the development of flowers and fruits and shorten the flowering and harvest periods. Compared with the control, 0.5% HC or 0.67% HC treatment increased the fruit yield of 5-year-old and 7-year-old bushes, especially early yield. Experiments carried out over two consecutive years in two different varieties, namely `M7' and `Brigitta', further confirmed the positive effect of 0.67% HC application on fruit yield. The results also showed that 0.67% HC had no negative effects on fruit quality. These findings may encourage growers to consider spraying HC in greenhouses to increase fruit yield, especially early yield, in order to schedule the harvest time for a more lucrative marketing period.","tags":["highbush blueberry; hydrogen cyanamide; buds break; fruit"],"title":"Effect of Hydrogen Cyanamide on Bud Break, Fruit Yield and Quality of Highbush Blueberry in Greenhouse Production","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aiqing Liu","Wensheng Xu","Xiaolei Xu","Jizhong Chen","Lijia An"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1614556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067530,"objectID":"7f20f8c36d8ff784b6f0f6050d35a6d7","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000627118700026/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:32:10.377543Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000627118700026/","section":"publication","summary":"The effects of nanorods on the structural, dynamical, and rheological properties of polymer matrix were investigated under shear flow via nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation.

Dormancy is a major obstacle for both fruit production in mild winter areas and off-season culture of fruit trees in protection facilities. It is very economically advantageous to be able to control the time point of bud break and consequently harvest in crops with high returns and short harvest seasons like blueberry (Vaccinium spp.). Hydrogen cyanamide (H2CN2 (HC)) treatment is an effective method to promote dormancy release and synchronize bud break in perennial deciduous fruit trees, including blueberry. However, there are few systematic studies of the metabolic changes that occur during HC-induced bud breaking. In this study, the metabolome of blueberry buds under forced conditions following HC and water treatment (control) was analyzed using gas chromatography paired with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) technology. A total of 252 metabolites were identified and 16 differential metabolites (VIP \u003e 1, p \u003c 0.05) were detected. The levels of several soluble sugars (fructose, glucose, maltose), organic acids (citric acid, alpha-ketoglutaric, succinic acid), and amino acids (aspartic acid, glutamic acid, phenylalanine) were upregulated, while tyrosine, tryptophan, and asparagine were significantly downregulated in HC-treated buds when compared with control buds. The synthesis and accumulation of phenylpropanoids (salicin, 4-vinylphenol, neohesperidin) were also promoted by HC. These results suggest that alteration of carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle increase, and phenylpropanoid accumulation were crucial in HC-promoted bud breaking in blueberry. This research extends our understanding of the mechanisms involved in dormancy release induced by HC and provides a theoretical basis for applying HC to accelerate bud break.","tags":["blueberry; metabolomics; bud break; hydrogen cyanide; phenylpropanoids"],"title":"Metabolomics Analysis Reveals the Mechanism of Hydrogen Cyanamide in Promoting Flower Bud Break in Blueberry","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Minglun Li","Bilin Zhuang","Yuyuan Lu","Lijia An","Zhen-Gang Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067531,"objectID":"8343da386adf0f667f8d803a33ee56c6","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000612557200031/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:32:10.851595Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000612557200031/","section":"publication","summary":"Salt-induced liquid-liquid phase separation in liquid mixtures is a common phenomenon in nature and in various applications, such as in separation and extraction of chemicals.

It is generally believed that knotting should increase polymer bending energy. However, many recent studies found that knotting can surprisingly decrease polymer bending energy, while the reason remains unclear. In this work, we quantitatively explained this surprising phenomenon using the tube model. In this model, polymer segments in a knot core are confined in a virtual tube. The tube affects the bending of knots in two opposite ways. First, the tube is curved to assume a knotted shape, which increases the bending. Second, the tube confinement suppresses the bending. We built a phase diagram to quantify the competition of these two effects. The second effect overwhelms under certain conditions because of two crucial yet often overlooked factors: (i) excluded volume interactions reduce the accessible diameter of the tube and (ii) polymer segments tend to escape the tube and thus produce an entropic force, which straightens the conformation. Overall, this work clarifies the special role of bending in polymer knots and demonstrates the usefulness of the tube model for polymer knots.","tags":[],"title":"Application of the Tube Model to Explain the Unexpected Decrease in Polymer Bending Energy Induced by Knot Formation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lu Li","Yikai Wang","Xiaobing Yu","Yongming Bao","Lijia An","Xiaowei Wei","Weiting Yu","Baoyi Liu","Junlei Li","Jiahui Yang","Yan Xia","Ge Liu","Fang Cao","Xiuzhi Zhang","Dewei Zhao"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1604188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067532,"objectID":"78cd0a4c7a9cb190a213eb3ca238359f","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000593876700004/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:32:12.249548Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000593876700004/","section":"publication","summary":"BackgroundNontraumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (NONFH) is a highly disabling orthopedic disease in young individuals.

Utilizing gain-of-function and knockdown approaches, we testified the regulatory effect of microRNA in exosomes.ResultsThe expression of PAI-1 was significantly increased in the local microenvironment of the femoral head in the ONFH model. GB-Exo promoted PAI-1 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells and vascular endothelial cells. We also revealed that miR-451-5p in GB-Exo plays a crucial role for the elevated PAI-1. Moreover, we identified miR-133b-3p and tested its role as a potential inhibitor of PAI-1.ConclusionsThis study provided considerable evidence for BMMSC exosomal miR-mediated upregulation of the fibrinolytic regulator PAI-1 in vascular cells. The disruption of coagulation and low fibrinolysis in the femoral head will eventually lead to a disturbance in the microcirculation of NONFH.

At high flow strengths, the star polymer with low functionality undergoes a large conformational change due to the tumbling motion, and the tumbling motion is suppressed with increasing functionality, whereas the star polymer with high functionality maintains a steady, stretched state via a trumpet shape. We attribute this phenomenon to the fact that the star polymer with high functionality perturbs the surrounding solvents more strongly at high flow strengths than that with lower functionality, leading to the higher additional hydrodynamic drag forces. These forces are balanced by certain forces in each direction and stabilize the high-functionality star polymer near the centerline due to its trumpet-shaped configuration.

The results showed that the specific hepatic markers, including alpha-fetoprotein (alpha FP/AFP), cytokeratin 18 (CK18), albumin (ALB) and glycogen, were increased in a dose-dependent manner.

We systematically studied the effects of solvent polarity on the control of the crystal structure of thin pi-conjugated polymer films in mixed solvent immersion. The polarity of poor solvents plays an important role in the crystallization behavior of the films, and the polarity of good solvents slightly influences the crystallization behavior of the thin P3HT films.

The results reveal that the polymer size increases monotonically with increasing shear rate when hydrodynamic interactions are ignored, in agreement with classic theoretical predictions. However, for the cases with hydrodynamic interactions, due to the transition from a linear to a nonlinear velocity profile, the size of both linear and ring chains exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence on the shear rate, and this counterintuitive behavior could be divided into three main regimes. At specific shear rates, linear polymers exhibit a relatively stable stretched state and a rapidly rotating collapsed state, which correspond to the maximum and minimum sizes, respectively. Although the rings behave similarly to the linear polymers, there exist two different relatively stable stretched states: one with an oval-shaped conformation and the other with an S-shaped conformation. For the oval-shaped state, the tumbling motion almost disappears but the tank-treading motion persists, whereas for the S-shaped state, both tumbling and tank-treading motions are greatly suppressed. Moreover, contrary to previous theoretical predictions, a noticeable bulge is observed for the polymer size in the gradient direction and the alignment angle deviates considerably from theoretical prediction, indicating the existence of relatively stable collapsed conformations at large shear rates for both linear and ring polymers. However, in ideal linear shear flow introduced by using the ``fix deform″ command to Dissipative Particle Dynamics system in LAMMPS package, both linear and ring polymers exhibit a monotonic dependence of size on shear rate. These results shed new light on the understanding of the dynamic response of linear and ring polymers in ultrahigh shear flows.","tags":[],"title":"Mechanism of Nonmonotonic Increase in Polymer Size: Comparison between Linear and Ring Chains at High Shear Rates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Baicheng Mei","Yuyuan Lu","Lijia An","Zhen-Gang Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067535,"objectID":"52c45aa10b87084e9016436e88b28fb0","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000496927300006/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:32:14.587246Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000496927300006/","section":"publication","summary":"It is well known that glass-forming liquids exhibit a number of anomalous dynamical phenomena, most notably a two-step relaxation in the self-intermediate scattering function and the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation, as they are cooled toward the glass transition temperature. While these phenomena are generally ascribed to dynamic heterogeneity, specifically to the presence of slow- and fast-moving particles, a quantitative elucidation of the two-step relaxation and the violation of the SE relation in terms of these concepts has not been successful. In this work, we propose a classification of particles according to the rank order of their displacements (from an arbitrarily defined origin of time), and we divide the particles into long-distance (LD), medium-distance, and short-distance (SD) traveling particle groups. Using molecular-dynamics simulation data of the Kob-Andersen model, we show quantitatively that the LD group is responsible for the fast relaxation in the two-step relaxation process in the intermediate scattering function, while the SD group gives rise to the slow (alpha) relaxation. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that tau(alpha) is controlled by the SD group, while the ensemble-averaged diffusion coefficient D is controlled by both the LD and SD groups. The combination of these two features provides a natural explanation for the breakdown in the SE relation at low temperature. In addition, we find that the alpha-relaxation time, tau(alpha), of the overall system is related to the relaxation time of the LD particles, tau(LD), as tau(alpha) = tau(0) exp(Omega tau(LD)/k(B)T).","tags":[],"title":"Two-step relaxation and the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation in glass-forming liquids","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cunliang Hu","Tongxin Lv","Jingqing Li","Shaoyong Huang","Hongfei Li","Jizhong Chen","Donghong Yu","Jesper de Claville Christiansen","Shichun Jiang","Lijia An"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067535,"objectID":"6ba99e0fb8c02aa173807d525fe21fbf","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000486361400031/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:32:15.530535Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000486361400031/","section":"publication","summary":"Polymer crystallization is crucial to the properties of polymers, which are determined by thermal dynamics and kinetics.

In addition, DAT and TH expression exhibited positive correlations with fatigue-related motor performance. CONCLUSIONS: We provided evidence of compensatory responses of striatal DAT and TH in the fatigued state, and treatments to relieve fatigue might upregulate the expression of both striatal DAT and TH.

Disease severity is IgE dose dependent and correlates with the degree of eosinophil infiltration in the skin. Furthermore, IgE autoantibodies fail to induce BP in eosinophil-deficient mice, confirming that eosinophils are required for IgE-mediated tissue injury. Thus, eosinophils provide the cellular link between IgE autoantibodies and skin blistering in this murine model of BP.

In addition, excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ethylene, decreased stomatal aperture and water loss, as well as abnormity of stomatal movement were also evident in the hyperhydric plantlets. The results suggested that excessive ethylene and ROS produced in response to the stress arising from in vitro culture could lead to abnormal stomatal closure, causing the accumulation of water in the tissues. This would lead to subsequent induction of oxidative stress (due to hypoxia) and cell damage, especially guard cell structure, eventually giving rise to the symptoms of hyperhydricity. Reducing the content of ethylene and ROS, and protecting the structure and function of the stomata could be considered as potential strategies for inhibiting hyperhydricity or restoring the hyperhydric plants to their normal state.","tags":["Blueberry; Hyperhydricity; ROS; Stomatal aperture; Water loss"],"title":"Hyperhydricity-induced ultrastructural and physiological changes in blueberry (vaccinium spp.)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hongbo Chen","Lijia An","Issei Nakamura"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1522540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067542,"objectID":"2bd9a2ba9249a2e37a5d05d0a0373114","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000430146200003/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:32:22.084586Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000430146200003/","section":"publication","summary":"Water dissolved in ionic liquids garners particular attention in electrochemistry, as represented by the case where water molecules cannot be completely removed from ionic liquids. Nevertheless, the effects of such polarizable polar molecules on the energy efficiency of electrochemical devices remain elusive. Thus, we highlight the effects of the spatially varying dielectric response of water and ionic liquid near charged plates using a coarse-grained mean-field theory that simultaneously accounts for both the permanent and induced dipole moments of the species and the strong electrostatic correlation. We show that water can be adsorbed onto electrodes primarily because of the dielectric contrast between the species. Our results predict that linear-dielectric theory is inadequate to account for the correlation between the capacitance and dielectric contrast, which may be fitted by exponential functions. Electronic polarizability can enhance the capacitance. A higher-dielectric component preferentially solvates electrodes, but this effect competes with that of the charge screening. Our theory shows that strong electrostatic correlation causes the dipolar cation and anion to form alternating layers, which in turn yields substantial increases in the capacitance. Our results compare favorably with previous molecular dynamics simulations.","tags":[],"title":"Water dissolution in ionic liquids between charged surfaces: effects of electric polarization and electrostatic correlation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qingling Wang","Fangling Ji","Jianli Guo","Yuepeng Wang","Yanyan Li","Jingyun Wang","Lijia An","Yongming Bao"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067543,"objectID":"4ab5a827b60e411c9e7e642c72365283","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000444221100007/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:32:23.023817Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000444221100007/","section":"publication","summary":"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia as one of increasing food spoilage bacteria and fish pathogens has become a threat to aquiculture industry.

Interestingly, a two-component system, comprising of LotS sensor and LotR regulator, for low-temperature response is also confirmed to modulate SmtP expression with similar effect to Clp. Evidence is presented that LotS/LotR modulates smtP (coding SmtP) expression via Clp: clp promoter activity was reduced significantly at low temperatures and protease activity was partially restored by Clp overexpressed in /otS or lotR deletion strain. Furthermore, as a Clp negative effector, the binding ability of c-di-GMP with Clp is not impacted by temperature. c-di-GMP level was increased in S. maltophilia growing at high temperature, but not exhibited significantly in lotR deleted strain, these indicate that LotR is required for temperature modulating c-di-GMP level, although the synthesis or degradation activity of c-di-GMP by LotR was not detected.

In the present study, 98.7% of the Dianthus chinensis L. plantlets cultured in a hyperhydricity induction medium (HIM) developed symptoms of hyperhydricity; however, hyperhydricity symptoms were inhibited to different degrees when D. chinensis L. plantlets were cultured in HIM supplemented with various concentrations of AgNO3. In particular, approximately 97% of the D. chinensis L. plantlets grew normally and did not show any symptoms of hyperhydricity when cultured in HIM supplemented with 30 mu mol L-1 AgNO3. Compared with the plantlets cultured in HIM alone, the plantlets cultured in HIM containing AgNO3 displayed dramatic decreases in water content, ethylene content, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (particularly regarding H2O2 accumulation in guard cells) and showed increased antioxidant enzyme activity, stoma aperture, and water loss.

We would expect our results to apply equally to other simple models, such as Lennard-Jones (LJ) systems. However, Hocky et al. presented a monotonic T-dependent xi(dyn)(c) in a LJ system. Therefore, the present work employs molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the T-dependent behavior of xi(dyn)(c) in the LJ system employed by Hocky et al. to clarify our expectation. Results employing a geometry size d that is somewhat smaller than that employed by Hocky et al. reveal that a non-monotonic behavior exists in the LJ system. By varying the value of d, we demonstrate that the formation of a peak in xi(dyn)(c) with respect to T in the LJ system is the natural result of wall effects. More importantly, a new non-monotonic behavior is observed, where the temperature at which the ratio of the characteristic time required for the overlap profile of the system to decay to a given value for a point near the wall to the corresponding characteristic time at a point in the center attains a maximum is in good agreement with the temperature Tmax-c at which xi(dyn)(c) attains a maximum value, indicating that the non-monotonic behavior of xi(dyn)(c) with respect to T is a natural property of liquids in a sandwiched geometry. Furthermore, we find that, contrary to HM systems, where the values of Tmax-c obtained for all values of d considered were greater than the mode-coupling temperature T-c, the value of Tmax-c obtained for LJ systems can be either greater than, equal to, or less than T-c because an HM system has a stronger finite-size effect than that in a LJ system, indirectly implying that the conclusion derived from random first-order transition theory that a dramatic change occurs near T-c bears no necessary relationship with the non-monotonic evolution of xi(dyn)(c) with respect to T.

Though ammonium-N is widely used as the main N source for growth of blueberry, few studies on ammonium damage to blueberry were reported. Objectives - The current research aimed to explore the effects of ammonium stress and supplemental calcium on blueberry growth using an in vitro model. Methods - In vitro cultured blueberry plantlets subjected to 1/4 MS itself containing 0.005M NH4+, 1/4 MS containing 0.01M NH4+, 1/4 MS containing 0.02M NH4+, 1/4 MS containing 0.02M NH4+ plus 0.01M Ca2+. Plant biomass, nutrient compositions and anti-oxidants in plantlets were analyzed. Results - Ammonium stress induced by 0.02M NH4+ significantly inhibited growth of in vitro cultured blueberry. Plants under ammonium stress showed the highest contents of N and Fe, and lowest contents of K, Ca, Mg and Mn. Ammonium stress also significantly inhibited contents of proline (Pro), Methane Dicarboxylic Aldehyde (MDA), soluble protein (SP) and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and promoted the activities of catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) and glutamine synthetase (GS). 0.01M supplemental Ca2+ proved to enhance the growth of blueberry plantlets exposed to ammonium stress with the obviously increased contents of K, Ca, Mg and Mn, Pro, MDA, SP and the increased activity of SOD. Close correlations were observed among plant biomass, nutrient compositions and anti-oxidants in blueberry plantlets. Conclusions - Ammonium stress affects growth of blueberry plantlets by regulating the allocation of nutrient composition and the anti-oxidant activity, which closely correlate with calcium signaling pathways. Supplemental Ca2+ could prevent ammonium damage. In vitro culture used as a model provides an effective and promising approach for study of plant stress, and a powerful technical support for field management of Vaccinium plants.","tags":["ammonium stress; enzyme activity; nutrient composition; plant biomass; supplemental Ca2+"],"title":"Ammonium stress and supplemental calcium influence growth of in vitro cultured blueberry plantlets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ruochen Liu","Ruinan Wang","Xin Yu","Lijia An"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1501545600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067546,"objectID":"00b8b39b49265ad7f2e853bb4b111d4e","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000406791800004/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:32:25.819552Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000406791800004/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, a new shape automatic clustering method based on multi-objective optimization with decomposition (MOEA/D-SAC) is proposed, which aims to find the final cluster number k as well as an optimal clustering result for the shape datasets.

Our work illustrates that the enhancement in the polypeptide hydrophobicity strengthens the short-range attractions between monomers, which elevates the electrostatic energy gain of the polypeptide/membrane complexity, but enlarges the conformational entropy loss of the shrunken polypeptide and demixing entropy loss of the segregated acidic lipids. These energy-entropy competitions result in qualitatively different dependences of anchoring/dissociation transition critical ionic concentration on hydrophobic monomer-monomer energy parameter eh for polypeptides with short and long chain lengths. In the anchoring region, we show that changing the polypeptide hydrophobicity leads to diverse chain conformations at various ionic concentrations for polypeptides with both short and long chain lengths. Furthermore, we illustrate the nontrivial feature of the reorganization of the acidic lipids underneath the anchored polypeptides. Our work demonstrates that the chain conformations of the anchored polypeptides with different hydrophobicities can be a key factor influencing the amounts and concentration gradients of the segregated acidic lipids. These findings suggest that polypeptide hydrophobicity provides an efficient molecular factor for tailoring the anchoring/association transition and interfacial structures of the polypeptide/membrane complexities, thereby offering insight into the innovation of new biotechnologies based on the functional switch of the anchored biopolymers and the regulation of messenger lipids.

Results showed that polymer architectures greatly influenced the dewetting behavior of the thin polymer film. On the silanized Si substrate with 69% grafting density, RPS chains exhibited stronger adsorption compared with LPS chains, and as a result the wetting layer formed more easily. For LPS films, with a decreased annealing temperature, the stability of the polymer film changed from non-slip dewetting via apparent slip dewetting to apparently stable. However, for RPS films, the polymer film stability switched from apparent slip dewetting to apparently stable. On the silanized Si substrate with 94% grafting density, the chain adsorption became weaker and the dewetting processes were faster than that on the substrate with 69% grafting density at the same experimental temperature for both the LPS and RPS films. Moreover, on the PDMS substrate, LPS films always showed non-slip dewetting, while the dewetting kinetics of RPS films switched from non-slip dewetting to slip dewetting behaviour.

In the transformation region, the flow-induced deformation, orientation, frequency of motions, and rheological properties show universal scaling relationships against the reduced Weissenberg number, independent of the number and the length of arms. Further, we make a comprehensive comparison on the flow-induced behaviors between linear, ring, and star polymers.

For this system, we consider the conditions under which multiple cationic polymers can anchor onto the monolayer and explore how the concentration and ionization degree of the polymers affect the lateral rearrangement and fluidity of the negatively charged lipids. Our work shows that the anchoring cationic polymers predominantly bind the tetravalent anionic PIP2 lipids and drag the PIP2 clusters to migrate on the monolayer. The polymer/PIP2 binding is found to be drastically enhanced by increasing the polymer ionization fraction, which causes the PIP2 lipids to form into larger clusters and reduces the mobility of the polymer/PIP2 complexes. As expected, stronger competition effects between anchoring polymers occur at higher polymer concentrations, for which each anchoring polymer partially dissociates from the monolayer and hence sequesters a smaller PIP2 cluster. The desorbed segments of the anchored polymers exhibit a faster mobility on the membrane, whereas the PIP2 dusters are closely restrained by the limited adhering cationic segments of anchoring polymers. We further demonstrate that the PIP2 molecules display a hierarchical mobility in the PIP2 clusters, which is regulated by the synergistic effect between the cationic segments of the polymers. The PS lipids sequester in the vicinity of the polymer/PIP2 complexes if the tetravalent PIP2 lipids cannot sufficiently neutralize the cationic polymers. Finally, we illustrate that the increase in the ionic concentration of the solution weakens the lateral clustering and the mobility heterogeneity of the charged lipids. Our work thus provides a better understanding of the fundamental biophysical mechanism of the concentration gradients and the hierarchical mobility of the anionic lipids in the membrane caused by the cationic polymer anchoring on length and time scales that are generally inaccessible by atomistic models. It also offers insight into the development and design of novel biological applications on the basis of the modulation of signaling lipids.","tags":[],"title":"Effects of Concentration and Ionization Degree of Anchoring Cationic Polymers on the Lateral Heterogeneity of Anionic Lipid Monolayers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peng Geng","Wenli Li","Joachim R. de Miranda","Zhou Qian","Lijia An","Olle Terenius"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1485907200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067552,"objectID":"f714624999f2d7ab1e8ff569dd173b1f","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000393268000020/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:32:31.873753Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000393268000020/","section":"publication","summary":"Antheraea pernyi Iflavirus (ApIV) is a virus that is the likely causative agent of A. pernyi Vomit Disease (AVD).

In this study, about 67% of the hyperhydric Dianthus chinensis L. plantlets were found to revert to normal condition when the plantlets were cultured in medium supplemented with 29.4 mu mol L-1 AgNO3. Water content and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content in the guard cells of these plantlets were reduced, while stomatal aperture and water loss rate were increased. AgNO3 also reduced the content of endogenous ethylene and expression of ethylene synthesis and ethylene signal transduction-associated genes. Reduced accumulation of ethylene consequently led to an increase in stomatal aperture mediated by decreased H2O2 content in the guard cells. These results adequately verified the role of AgNO3 in the reversion of hyperhydricity in D. chinensis L. and also provided clues for exploring the cause of excessive water accumulation in hyperhydric plants.

Using this model, we extensively explore the effects of important factors on the structural alterations of the polymers/monolayer complex, including the polymer concentration, the polymer ionization fraction and the ionic concentration of the salt solution. We find the substantial disparity in the scaling of the anchoring/dissociation transition for polymers/monolayer complex and polyelectrolyte/surface system, which demonstrates that the mobile anionic monolayer exerts stronger attraction on cationic polymers than uniformly charged surface, thereby illustrating the significant predominance of PIP2 lipids in the anchoring procedure. In the polymer anchoring regime, increasing the polymer ionization fraction drastically strengthens the attractions between polymers and the monolayer at low polymer concentrations, which in turn results in the transformation of individual polymer chains from a brush-like structure to a pancake-like structure and leads to the enhancement of PIP2 sequestration. Elevating the polymer concentration strengthens the competition of the anchoring between individual polymers, and the fraction of anchored polymers can even saturate at sufficiently high polymer concentrations. At high polymer concentrations, this competition forces both weakly and strongly charged polymers to anchor onto the membrane in the brush-like conformation, thereby sequestering smaller PIP2 clusters. The PS lipids cluster around the polymer/PIP2 complexes when the amount of tetravalent PIP2 lipids is insufficient to neutralize the anchored cationic polymers. We also observe that the monolayer can be overcharged due to the anchoring of polymers at high polymer concentrations.

Interestingly, its activity increased about 1.6-fold under high salt condition. The enzyme remains active and stable in different organic solvents (50 %, v/v) such as dimethylsulfoxide, dimethyl formamide, dioxane and acetone.

In particular, we explore how chain rigidity and polymer concentration influence the spatial rearrangement and mobility heterogeneity of the monolayer under the conditions where the cationic polymers anchor on the monolayer. We find that the anchored cationic polymers only sequester the tetravalent PIP2 lipids at low polymer concentrations, where the interaction strength between the polymers and the monolayer exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the degree of chain rigidity. Specifically, maximal anchoring occurs at low polymer concentrations, when the polymer chains have an intermediate degree of rigidity, for which the PIP2 clustering becomes most enhanced and the mobility of the polymer/PIP2 complexes becomes most reduced. On the other hand, at sufficiently high polymer concentrations, the anchoring strength decreases monotonically as the chains stiffena result that arises from the pronounced competitions among polymer chains. In this case, the flexible polymers can confine all PIP2 lipids and further sequester the univalent PS lipids, whereas the stiffer polymers tend to partially dissociate from the monolayer and only sequester smaller PIP2 clusters with greater mobilities. We further illustrate that the mobility gradient of the single PIP2 lipids in the sequestered clusters is sensitively modulated by the cooperative effects between anchored segments of the polymers with different rigidities. Our work thus demonstrates that the rigidity and concentration of anchored polymers are both important parameters for tuning the regulation of anionic lipids.","tags":["semiflexible polymers; anchoring; sequestration; mobility; anionic lipid; Monte Carlo"],"title":"Spatial Rearrangement and Mobility Heterogeneity of an Anionic Lipid Monolayer Induced by the Anchoring of Cationic Semiflexible Polymer Chains","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bing Li","Zhaoyan Sun","Lijia An","Zhen-Gang Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1462060800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067555,"objectID":"134f9248400ebd452ac1472ce001ddf2","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000375885200017/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:32:35.154287Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000375885200017/","section":"publication","summary":"The scaling behavior of the second virial coefficient of ring polymers at the theta temperature of the corresponding linear polymer (theta(L)) is investigated by off-lattice Monte Carlo simulations.

However, research focusing on NMD in plant is still lacking compared to the research that has been dedicated to NMD in mammals and yeast. Even so, recent study has shown that NMD factors in Arabidopsis can provide resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses. This discovery and its associated developments have given plant NMD mechanism a new outlook and since then, more and more research has focused on this area. In this review, we focused mainly on the distinctive NMD micromechanism and functions of Upf proteins in plant with references to the role of mRNA surveillance in mammals and yeast. We also highlighted recent insights into the roles of premature termination codon location, trans-elements and functions of other NMD factors to emphasize the particularity of plant NMD.

Our results show significant stretching of the primitive chain up to many Rouse times, followed by retraction, as the primary origin of stress overshoot for deformation rates lower than the reciprocal of the Rouse time but higher than the reciprocal of the reptation time. The analysis of such results reveals heterogeneous local chain stretching, demonstrating the coupling between stretching and orientation that extends to times considerably longer than the Rouse time. Explicit comparison between the simulation and the theoretical description from the GLaMM theory shows marked differences.

The enhancement of the polyelectrolyte chain intrinsic rigidity reduces the polyelectrolyte conformational entropy loss and the energy gains in electrostatic interaction, but elevates the segregated anionic lipid demixing entropy loss. This energy-entropy competition results in a nonmonotonic dependence of the polyelectrolyte/monolayer association strength on the degree of chain rigidity. The semiflexible polyelectrolyte, i.e., the one with an intermediate degree of chain rigidity, is shown to associate onto the ternary membane below a higher critical ionic concentration. In this ionic concentration regime, the semiflexible polyelectrolyte binds onto the monolayer more firmly than the pancake-like flexible one and exhibits a stretched conformation. When the chain is very rigid, the polyelectrolyte with bead charge density Z(b) = +1 exhibits a larger tail and tends to dissociate from the membrane, whereas the one with Z(b) = +2 can still bind onto the membrane in a bridge-like conformation.

In the non-Newtonian regime ((gamma) over dot \u003e tau(-1)(0)), the shear dependence of viscosity exhibits a crossover at a critical shear rate (gamma) over dot(c) dividing this regime into two different regimes, shear thinning regime I (ST-I) and II (ST-II), respectively.

The simulation results show that the difference in the critical micellization concentration (cmc) values between ring-like copolymers and linear copolymers with same compositions is closely related to the content of A blocks, f(A), and the strength of attractive interaction between B monomers, epsilon. When fA is relatively small and e is big, the cmc values of ring-like block copolymers are smaller than those of the corresponding linear ones; whereas when fA is big and e is small, the cmc values of triblock copolymers are smaller than those of the corresponding ring-like ones. To further understand the effect of fA and e on the micellization behavior, we calculated the entropy and the potential energy contributions to the micellization free energy, respectively. The results show that in the studied range of fA and 8, the entropy loss in micellization for ring-like block copolymers is always smaller than that for triblock copolymers, so it seems that the micellization of ring-like block copolymers is always easier than that of the linear ones if we only consider the entropy contributions to the free energy. But if we calculate the potential energy contributions to the free energy, it can be found when fA is relatively small and 8 is big, the potential energy decreases greatly during the micellization of ring-like block copolymers. Considering the less unfavorable contribution of entropy part to the free energy for ring-like block copolymers, the micellization of ring-like block copolymers should be much easier than that of the linear ones. When f(A), is big and e is small, the potential energy decreases greatly when the micelles form for linear block copolymers. Although the entropic contribution to the free energy is unfavorable for linear ones, the potential energy still shows the dominative contribution to the free energy and therefore the micellization of linear block copolymers is much easier than the ring-like ones. The above analysis of the free energy will help us understand the micellization behavior of ring-like block copolymers and linear block copolymers.","tags":["Ring-like block copolymer; Micellization; Monte Carlo simulation"],"title":"Computer Simulation of Micellization for Ring-like Block Copolymers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Feifei Xue","Xuesi Chen","Lijia An","Sergio S.

The time constants of activation (tau (m)) and inactivation (tau (h)) kinetics were extracted from fitting of the Na current (m(3)h) according to the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model. By comparing the time constants without and with the laser irradiation, we obtained that laser pulses changed the Na current kinetics by accelerating tau (h)-phase and slowing down tau (m)-phase at the beginning of the laser pulse, whereas both phases were accelerated at the end of the pulse. After relating the ratios of the time constants to the temperature characteristics of Na channel by Q (10), we found that the accelerating in Na current kinetics could be related to the average temperature of extracellular solution in the corresponding time span by choosing Q (10) = 2.6. The results of this study demonstrated that there was a positive correlation between the acceleration of the Na current kinetics and increases in temperature of the extracellular solution.","tags":["Temporal modulation; Na current kinetics; Photothermal effect; Near-infrared laser interaction with cell; HH-model"],"title":"Temporal Modulation of Sodium Current Kinetics in Neuron Cells by Near-Infrared Laser","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wang Zhao","Jia Yuxi","Xu Yihan","Shi Tongfei","An Lijia"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1383264000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067567,"objectID":"e8d8dd7b2eddac4faaedd56bc1b779a7","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000328574000008/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:32:47.343334Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000328574000008/","section":"publication","summary":"The application of nanofiltration in industrial fields is increasing rapidly in recent years, especially in drinking water treatment. Nevertheless, the mechanism of mass transport through these membranes has not yet been fully understood. And the optimal design of nanofiltration processes still faces challenges. At first, the Donnan Steric Pore Model (DSPM) is described in this paper, which is constructed on the basis of the extended Nernst-Planck equation for the prediction of the nanofiltration process of polymeric membrane. Then the DSPM model is used to characterize three kinds of membranes (AFC40, CA30 and NTR7450) for the nanofiltration of 50 mol/m(3) NaCl solution and NTR7450 membrane for the nanofiltration of NaCl and MgSO4 solution with different concentrations. The simulated results and their comparison with experimental results show that the DSPM model can effectively predict the membrane performance. And then a description of the Pores and Polarization Transport Model (PPTM) is presented, which is developed on the basis of the DSPM model, in order for characterizing cross-flow nanofiltration. The PPTM model combines the convection-diffusion-migration transport in the nanopores with the transport through the concentration polarization layer. To improve the PPTM model in the aspect of using an empirical model to describe the velocity field of solution above the membrane, the velocity profile in solution is solved by Navier-Stokes equation and continuity equation in this paper. The cross-flow nanofiltration of polymeric membrane is simulated using the finite element method, by coupling mass transfer in the membrane with ion concentration and velocity profile in solution above the membrane. By the comparison with experimental results and traditional PPTM results, it can be found that the modified method can reflect the change tendencies of ion concentration and velocity profile in solution, and their values are more in line with the values of experiments. The improved model can provide more reliable theoretical basis for the optimal design of cross-flow nanofiltration processes of polymeric membrane.","tags":["nanofiltration membrane; concentration polarization; transport model; velocity profile; finite element simulation"],"title":"Finite Element Analysis on Multi-field Coupling of Cross-flow Nanofiltration of Polymeric Membrane","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yihan Xu","Yanyan Zhang","Yuxi Jia","Lijia An"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1383264000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067566,"objectID":"141fa8f3d0af0ab1dc4d85403702926f","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000336961900144/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:32:46.424506Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000336961900144/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Concentration distribution; Drug slow-release; Hydrogel; Finite element simulation"],"title":"Finite element simulation of slow release of drugs using hydrogels as carriers with various drug concentration distributions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yao Zhang","Zhijie Zhang","Hongfei Li","Donghong Yu","Yingrui Shang","Lijia An","Shichun Jiang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1383264000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067566,"objectID":"3c9277c1f92e45ddcdc38991eb240ddc","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000327529300001/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:32:45.966445Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000327529300001/","section":"publication","summary":"The dielectric relaxation spectroscopy results indicate that the relaxation peak of PCL for pure PCL and PCL/LiClO4 complexes shifts to a lower frequency with increasing crystallization temperature, while the amorphous, condensed structure of PCL for pure PCL and PCL/LiClO4 complexes is slightly affected by crystallization temperature.

We also examined the relationship between the expression of caveolin-1 and synaptophysin, a marker of synaptic plasticity. Hippocampal caveolin-1 and synaptophysin expression in aged (22-24 month old) rats was significantly lower than that in young (1 month old) and adult (4 months old) rats. Expression levels of both proteins were significantly greater in the cortex of aged rats than in that of young or adult rats, and levels were similar between the three age groups in the cerebellum. Linear regression analysis revealed that hippocampal expression of synaptophysin was associated with memory and learning abilities. Moreover, synaptophysin expression correlated positively with caveolin-1 expression in the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum. These results confirm that caveolin-1 has a regulatory effect on synaptic plasticity, and suggest that the downregulation of hippocampal caveolin-1 expression causes a decrease in synaptic plasticity during physiological aging.","tags":["neural regeneration; cognitive function; aging; caveolin-1; synaptic plasticity; hippocampus; synaptophysin; grants-supported paper; neuroregeneration"],"title":"Downregulation of caveolin-1 contributes to the synaptic plasticity deficit in the hippocampus of aged rats","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wenduo Chen","Jizhong Chen","Lijun Liu","Xiaolei Xu","Lijia An"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1377993600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067568,"objectID":"3e5778ad3a2317467859c68df5c4daf3","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000330145700042/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:32:48.282975Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000330145700042/","section":"publication","summary":"Individual semiflexible ring polymers in a steady shear flow are studied by the multiparticle collision dynamics method combined with molecular dynamics simulations.

For larger Weissenberg numbers, the effects of chain stiffness are observed. We find that the radius of gyration tensor elements, the orientation resistance parameter, and the alignment distribution functions show strong stiffness dependences. The scaling behavior of tumbling motion corresponding to large conformational changes is found independent of chain stiffness, while the scaling behavior of tank-treading motion corresponding to the motion of monomers moving along the contour of the chain exhibits a chain stiffness dependence in the crossover regime from a flexible to a rigid ring polymer.

Our results show that both the average radii of gyration (\u003c Rg \u003e) and hydrodynamic radius (\u003c Rh \u003e) are scaled to the weight-average molar mass (Mw) as \u003c R-g \u003e similar to \u003c R-h \u003e similar to (MwMw,s phi)-M-gamma with gamma = 0.47 +/- 0.01 and phi = 0.10 +/- 0.01; and their intrinsic viscosity ([eta]) quantitatively follow the Mark- Houwink-Sakurada (MHS) equation as [eta] = K-eta M-w M-nu(w,s) (mu) with K-eta = 2.26 x 10(-5),. nu = 0.39 +/- 0.01, and mu = 0.31 +/- 0.01, revealing that these model chains with long subchains are indeed fractal objects. Further, our theoretical and experimental results broadly agree with each other besides a slight deviation from the MHS equation for short subchains, similar to dendrimers, presumably due to the multi- body hydrodynamic interaction. Moreover, we also find that the average viscometric radius (\u003c R-eta \u003e) determined from intrinsic viscosity is slightly smaller than \u003c R-h \u003e measured in dynamic LLS and their ratio (\u003c R eta \u003e/\u003c Rh \u003e) roughly remains 0.95 +/- 0.05, reflecting that linear polymer chains are more draining with a smaller \u003c R-h \u003e than their hyperbranched counterparts for a given intrinsic viscosity. Our current study of the `` defect- free″ hyperbranched polymer chains offers a standard model for further theoretical investigation of hydrodynamic behaviors of hyperbranched polymers and other complicated architectures, in a remaining unexploited research field of polymer science.

The coarse-grained model is based on serum albumin and a polycation system, and the MC simulation of pH impact on complex coacervation has been carried out. We found that complex coacervates could form three ways, but the conventional association through electrostatic attraction between the protein and polysaccharide still dominated the complex coacervation in such systems. We also observed that the depletion potential always participated in protein crowding and was weakened in the presence of strong electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, we observed that the sizes of polysaccharide chains nonmonotonically increased with the number of bound proteins.

The present paper examined two popular models describing the swelling and deformation behaviors of polyelectrolyte hydrogels, i.e. the multiphasic model and the transport model. The water flow, the network deformation and the ionic diffusion are coupled in the multiphasic model, and the gradient of the fluid pressure is taken as the driving force for the network deformation. However, the water flow is neglected in the transport model with the ionic osmotic pressure taking the role of fluid pressure. Two simplified experiments, i.e. the free swelling of a hydrogel sphere in response to the concentration change of the external salt solution and the bending deformation of a hydrogel strip under an external electric field, are simulated by the two models. Simulation shows that the two models lead to the same predictions for the swelling equilibrium of the hydrogel sphere but different predictions for the swelling kinetics of the hydrogel sphere and the deformation of the hydrogel strip under the external electric field. These are due to the fact that the two models are equivalent in thermodynamic equilibrium situations, but in thermodynamic non-equilibrium situations, the transport model is no longer applicable as it neglects the water flow in the hydrogel and takes the ionic osmotic pressure as a mechanical parameter to play the role of swelling pressure. The present work will be helpful for understanding the hydrodynamics of polyelectrolyte hydrogels and the application of the two models. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we have found that mMCP-4 is critical in a mouse model of the autoimmune skin blistering disease bullous pemphigoid (BP). Mice lacking mMCP-4 were resistant to experimental BP. Complement activation, mast cell (MC) degranulation, and the early phase of neutrophil (PMN) recruitment occurred comparably in mMCP-4(-/-) and WT mice. However, without mMCP-4, activation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 was impaired in cultured mMCP-4(-/-) MCs and in the skin of pathogenic IgG-injected mMCP-4(-/-) mice. MMP-9 activation was not fully restored by local reconstitution with WT or mMCP-4(-/-) PMNs. Local reconstitution with mMCP-4(-/-) MCs, but not with mMCP-4(-/-) MCs, restored blistering, MMP-9 activation, and PMN recruitment in mMCP-4(-/-) mice. mMCP-4 also degraded the hemidesmosomal transmembrane protein BP180 both in the skin and in vitro. These results demonstrate that mMCP-4 plays two different roles in the pathogenesis of experimental BP, by both activating MMP-9 and by cleaving BP180, leading to injury of the hemidesmosomes and extracellular matrix of the basement membrane zone.","tags":[],"title":"Dual Targets for Mouse Mast Cell Protease-4 in Mediating Tissue Damage in Experimental Bullous Pemphigoid","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lin Xu","Dipankar Bandyopadhyay","Tongfei Shi","Lijia An","Ashutosh Sharma","Sang Woo Joo"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1314835200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067580,"objectID":"77346fd2cfb81c2c58b4b919b579f289","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000294796300021/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:32:59.980125Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000294796300021/","section":"publication","summary":"A combined experimental and computational study is presented to uncover the dewetting kinetics of the PS/PMMA system by changing the film thickness of the PMMA under layer. On the low M(w), PMMA (M(w) = 15 kg/mol) layer, the dewetting velocity of PS film firstly rapidly decreases (regime I), and then becomes almost invariant (regime II) with the increase of the film thickness of the liquid lower layer. Experiments suggest that the transition from regime I to regime II is correlative with the property of the solid substrates. The linear stability analysis of thin bilayers uncovers a bimodal behaviour of the instability under the experimental conditions and changeover of dominant mode of instability from one interface to the other is the major reason behind the switching of regimes. The nonlinear simulations closely mimic the experimental interfacial morphologies and suggest two different pathways of hole growth for regimes I and II under experimental condition. The simulations also indicate that the rapid reduction in the dewetting velocity is because of the increased excursion or penetration of the upper layer into the lower layer near the three phase contact line as the viscous resistance at the more viscous PMMA layer reduces with its increasing thickness. A qualitative match is thus found between the experimental and theoretical trends of the dewetting velocities. In addition, the experiments show that on a high M(w) PMMA (M(w) = 365 kg/mol) layer, the kinetics of hole growth of the PS layer is not affected by the PMMA layer thickness. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Thirdly, the origin of dendrimers' anomalous intrinsic viscosity is elucidated in the microscopic scale, namely the competition of the number fraction between the two kinds of monomers without the capability of dragging solvent, which is caused by the increase of volume of the core and the back-folding ability caused by entropy effect. Finally, it is physically elucidated that the nature of the intrinsic viscosity is the reflection of the ability per monomer of dendrimer to averagely drag solvent molecules alone rather than the reflection of the degree of polymerization.

So a numerical simulation algorithm is developed to analyze the complex mold-filling process with edge effect. The newly modified governing equations involving the effect of mold cavity thickness on flow patterns and the volume-averaging momentum equations containing viscous and inertia terms are adopted to describe the fluid flow in the edge area and in the fiber preform, respectively. The volume of fluid (VOF) method is applied to tracking the free interface between the two types of fluids, namely the resin and the air. Under constant pressure injection conditions, the effects of transverse permeability, edge channel width, and mold cavity thickness on flow patterns are analyzed. The results demonstrate that the transverse flow is not only affected by the transverse permeability and the edge channel width but also by the mold cavity thickness. The simulated results are in agreement with the experimental results. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The gradient of chemical/electrochemical potentials of water and mobile ions is taken as the driving force for the volume change of the polyelectrolyte hydrogel, which is damped by the frictional forces between different phases and balanced by the elastic restoring force of the polymer network. Employing the model constructed here, the free swelling of a spherical polyelectrolyte hydrogel immersed in salt solution is simulated by the finite element method. The simulation shows that the polyelectrolyte hydrogel swells from the surface to the interior when the concentration of the external salt solution decreases. The swelling kinetics for ordinary hydrogels with high frictional coefficient between the polymer network and water is controlled by the collective diffusion of the polymer network, while for fast-response hydrogels it is controlled by the ionic diffusion in the hydrogel.

We first investigated the expression of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) genes in resting and BV-infected HD11 (chicken macrophage-like cell line) and DT40 (chicken B cell-like cell line) cells. Expressions of TLRs were detected in both cell types. After BV stimulation, TLR21 was the only upregulated TLR in HD11 cells, and all the TLRs were down-regulated in DT40 cells. Since TLR activation generally leads to cytokine induction, we then determined the expression of IL-12 in the two cell lines following treatment with BV or oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) containing CpG dinucleotides (CpG-ODN). BV and CpG-ODN treatment induced the expression of IL-12 in HD11 but not in DT40 cells. HD11 cells transfected with siRNA specific for TLR21 significantly diminished BV- and CpG-ODN-induced IL-12 expression. Therefore, BV and CpG-ODN stimulated IL-12 expression involved TLR21 signaling and chicken TLR21 may have similar functions to the mammalian TLR9. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The addition of the liquid underlayer generated complex nonmonotonic behavior of the dewetting velocity as a function of increasing h(M). In particular, we observed an acceleration of dewetting for an intermediate range of h(M). This phenomenon has been interpreted by a combination deformation of the middle elastic layer and a concurrent change in the contact angle. On one hand, deformation led to the formation of a trench that dissipated energy during its movement through the liquid underlayer and thus caused a slowing down of dewetting. However, with an increase in the thickness of the elastic middle layer, the size of the trench decreased and its influence on the dewetting velocity also decreased. On the other hand, the deformation of the elastic layer also led to an increase in the contact angle.

The competition between interfacial energy and entropy results in the formation of lamellar structures and the increasing thickness of the lamellar layer with increasing rod volume fraction. When the rod volume fraction is high, the graft density of the planar interface is decreased, which results in space-filling requirements and stretching penalty, thus leading to the stability of nonlamellar structures with curing interface. Furthermore, our results also suggest that the effect of the chain architecture on the self-assembled behavior is remarkable when the rod volume fraction is low, whereas the effect is weak when the rod volume fraction is high.

A dual-Arrhenius viscosity model is newly introduced to describe the chemorheological behavior of a modified bismaleimide resin. The influence of the curing reaction and processing parameters on the resin flow patterns was investigated. The results indicate that, under constant-flow velocity conditions, the curing reaction caused an obvious increase in the injection pressure and its influencing degree was greater with increasing resin temperature or preform permeability. Both a small change in the resin viscosity and the alteration of the injection flow velocity hardly affected the resin flow front. However, the variation of the preform permeability caused an obvious shape change in the resin flow front. The simulated results were in agreement with the experimental results.

Recently, its indications have been extended experimentally to a wider range of disorders especially some central nervous system (CNS) disorders. In this study, we investigated whether nimodipine is neuroprotective to inflammation-mediated neurodegenerative diseases. Pretreatment with nimodipine reduced the degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons induced by LPS in mesencephalic neuron-glia cultures in a dose-dependent manner. The neuroprotective effect of nimodipine was attributed to the inhibition of microglial activation, since nimodipine significantly inhibited the production of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) from LPS-stimulated microglia. Moreover, nimodipine was not neuroprotective to 1-methyi-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-induced DA neurotoxicity in the absence of microglia. Mechanistic study showed that nimodipine failed to protect the degeneration of neurons in neuron-glia cultures from mice lacking functional NADPH oxidase (PHOX), a key enzyme for extracellular superoxide production in immune cells. Taken together these results suggest that nimodipine is protective to DA neurodegeneration via inhibiting the microglial-mediated oxidative stress and inflammatory response. Thus, nimodipine may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of inflammation-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the ovary-drip method for directly generating vector- and selectable marker-free transgenic plants was described, by which maize was transformed with a linear GFP cassette (Ubi-GFP-nos). The key features of this method center on the complete removal of the styles and the subsequent application of a DNA solution directly to the ovaries. The movement of the exogenous DNA was monitored using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled DNA, which showed that the time taken by the exogenous DNA to enter the ovaries was shortened compared to that of the pollen-tube pathway. This led to an improved transformation frequency of 3.38% compared to 0.86% for the pollen-tube pathway as determined by PCR analysis. The use of 0.05% surfactant Silwet L-77 + 5% sucrose as a transformation solution further increased the transformation frequency to 6.47%.

Green fluorescence was observed in roots and immature embryos of transgenic plants by fluorescence microscopy. Progeny analysis showed that GFP insertions were inherited in T-1 generation.

By incorporating the self consistent field theory with the free energy approach Lattice Boltzmann model, hydrodynamic interactions can be considered. Compared with models based on Ginzburg-Landau free energy, this model does not employ phenomenological free energies to describe systems. The model is verified by comparing the simulation results obtained using this method with those of a dynamical version of the self consistent mean field theory. After that,the growth exponents of the characteristic domain size for symmetric block copolymers at late stage are studied. It is found that the viscosity of the system affects the growth exponents greatly, although the growth exponents are all less than 1/3 Furthermore, the relations between the growth exponent, the interaction parameter and the chain length are studied. The rescaled simulation results show that the dependence of growth exponent on the interaction parameter is trivial; however,the length of the polymer chain may lead to the change of the growth exponent. This conclusion is different from that based on a free energy function given by the Ginzburg Landau expression. This difference may come from the additional correlation considered in the self consistent field theory of our model. Nevertheless, the chain length effect on the growth exponent is little compared with that of the fluid viscosity.","tags":["Lattice Boltzmann method; Microphase separation; Block copolymers; Coarsening"],"title":"STUDY OF COARSENING OF MICRODOMAINS IN BLOCK COPOLYMERS BY LATTICE BOLTZMANN METHODS","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jianfeng Liu","Qiao Su","Lijia An","Aifu Yang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1233446400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067600,"objectID":"3a898b1b7be44d8abb831e7fa121265d","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000262123500019/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:33:20.167134Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000262123500019/","section":"publication","summary":"A tissue culture-independent plant transformation method, called ovary-drip transformation, was established in which a minimal linear gene cassette [35S CaMV promoter, open reading frame of soluble modified green fluorescent protein (smGFP), and NOS terminator] was transformed into soybean.

Firstly, a novel two-phase approach to monodisperse nanocrystals, which is different from the well-established synthesis models, is discussed. We demonstrate that the two-phase approach has a quite lengthy nucleation process, and can be applied to the synthesis of many kinds of binary monodisperse nanocrystals. Then, we provide a summary of recent research progress in the observation and understanding of nucleation and growth of semiconductor nanocrystals in one-phase and two-phase systems, and compare the nucleation and growth mechanisms of the two kinds of reaction systems. Although the lengthy nucleation process of the two-phase approach enables researchers to capture some useful information about the nucleation and growth processes, and the nucleation and growth processes have been studied by optical absorption spectra and transmission electron microscopy, there is little or no experimental data available on the atomic configurations of critical nuclei. Finally, the current difficulties and future challenges in synthesis and structural characterization of critical nuclei are presented.","tags":[],"title":"Controlled synthesis of monodisperse nanocrystals by a two-phase approach without the separation of nucleation and growth processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aifu Yang","Qiao Su","Lijia An","Jianfeng Liu","Wei Wu","Ze Qiu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067602,"objectID":"dde840fb33ccdac24322cda23b0a1f41","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000262795600001/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:33:21.596778Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000262795600001/","section":"publication","summary":"The pollen-tube pathway is feasible to transform vector- and selectable marker-free linear gene cassettes into plants to address the biosafety issues.

At 185 degrees C, above the critical temperature, the amounts of PMMA and SAN phases were comparable. At lower temperatures PMMA migrated to the surface, leading to a much higher PMMA surface content than in the bulk. The migration and preferential segregation of a blend component in thin films demonstrated here are responsible for the great difference between in situ and ex situ experimental (not real quenching or annealing) results of polymer blend films, and help explain the slow kinetics of surface phase separation at early stage for blend thin films reported in literature.

Incubation with isocamptothecin resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of HaCaT cell proliferation. However, isocamptothecin showed larger inhibitory concentration at 50% than camptothecin, suggesting far less cytotoxicity. In addition, isocamptothecin induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner and induced typical morphologic features of apoptosis in HaCaT cells. Moreover, isocamptothecin downregulated the telomerase activity of HaCaT cells not only at concentrations of apoptosis induction but also at concentration insufficient to induce apoptosis, providing additional mechanisms that further account for its ability to inhibit keratinocytes proliferation and induce apoptosis. These results indicate that isocamptothecin possesses similar effects on keratinocytes with camptothecin, but shows far less cytotoxicity, it may probably become a promising agent for psoriasis therapy.","tags":["apoptosis; camptothecin analogue; keratinocyte; telomerase"],"title":"Effects of isocamptothecin, a novel camptothecin analogue, on proliferation, apoptosis and telomerase activity in HaCaT cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hongzhou Li","Yuxi Jia","Shifang Luan","Qian Xiang","Charles C.

Due to the complexity of the inner structure and gelation mechanism, it is difficult to obtain purposefully polymer physical gel materials with specific constitution and properties. Thus, the controllable preparation and application of polymer physical gels are a long-term work. As a numerical simulation method in macro-scale the finite element method has been used to the study of chemical gelation,but rarely to physical gelation presently. The reasons may be: compared with chemical gels the gelation process of physical gels is more complex resulting from the bigger complexity of the system composition and physical interactions. Several kinds of interactions and steps may be involved in one physical gelation proeess. And under different conditions the gelation mechanisms are frequently different. By now the understanding of the gelation mechanisms of many kinds of physical gels is far from being intensive; the phenomenological gelation kinetics models are usually nonlinear; the theory describing the relation between the microscopic and mesoscopic structure and the macroscopic properties is still immature. For all the factors mentioned above the numerical simulation of physical gelation process in macro-scale comes to be a difficult work. In order to optimize raw material formulation and physical gelation conditions, and then obtain polymer physical gels according to requirements, the spatial distribution and time evolution characteristics of the temperature field during the gelation process were studied via the finite element method. On the basis of the temperature field calculated, the complex shear modulus field of gel system was numerically simulated according to a first-order gelation kinetic equation, and the effects of raw material concentration, sample size and cooling modes on the physical gelation were discussed. Rennet casein gel is a kind of particle gel, whose formation is controlled by physical forces including steric-hydration force and van der Waals force, and whose structure and properties are influenced by many parameters including emulsifying salts I pH, thermal and shear history. The formation process of the gel network can be divided into three steps, molecules-particles-flocs-network. Casein floes are fractal objects that can be partially filled by the constructing units (particles). The fractal dimension of the floes and the size of the particles are two important parameters determining the gel microscopic structure and rheological properties. Experimental results show that cooling modes will influence the rheological properties of the gel through influencing the size of the particles. The formation of rennet casein gels is a first-order kinetics process. Three examples were studied. The raw material concentrations of example I and example 2 are both 18% but the sample size of the former is five times as that of the latter; the raw material concentration of example 3 is 25%, and the sample size is same with example 1. The gel zone is divided into 136 unites and 163 nodes; the prototype zone is divided into 28 unites and 40 nodes; four representative nodes were selected in the gel zone, and were emphatically studied. The initial system temperature is set at 80 degrees C and cooling modes Include (I) environmental temperature declines from 80 degrees C to 5 degrees C and cooling rates are espectively 0.5 K/min, 0.25 K/min, 0.1 K/min, 0.05 K/min, 0.025 K/min; (2) environmental temperature maintains 5 degrees C. The simulated results show that ( I) the rate of temperature decrease near the surface is larger than that near the center the gelation occurs on the surface first; as the infinite complex shear modulus is determined by the cooling rate of the pre-gelation phase, the value of the complex shear modulus of the interior exceeds that of the exterior finally. The asymmetric distribution of temperature field results in the asymmetric distribution of mechanical property field of the gel. And with the increase of environmental cooling rate and sample size the asymmetry becomes more obvious.","tags":["physical gel; rennet casein; finite element simulation; temperature field; complex shear modulus field"],"title":"Finite element simulation of the physical gelation of rennet casein","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xluli Zhang","Aihong Zhang","Bo Jiang","Yongming Bao","Jingyun Wang","Lijia An"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1212278400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067618,"objectID":"8281f425f274592e4ecb7506b65d862c","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000258561700012/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:33:38.444078Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000258561700012/","section":"publication","summary":"We have previously evaluated the neuroprotective effect of catalpol on aging mice induced by D-galactose, in which catalpol treatment ameliorated cognition deficits and attenuated oxidative damage in mice brain. To thoroughly elucidate the anti-aging effects of catalpol, the liver and spleen antioxidative systems and energy metabolism in senescent mice induced by D-galactose have been studied. Except control group, mice were subcutaneously injected with D-galactose (150 mg kg(-1) body weight) for 6 weeks. Meanwhile, drug group mice were treated with catalpol (2.5, 5, 10mg kg(-1) body weight) and piracetam (300mg kg(-1) body weight) for the last 2 weeks. The activities of endogenous antioxidants and the level of glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxide in the liver and spleen were assayed. Compared to control group, model group mice had significantly lower spleen index (spleen weight/body weight), lower level of GSH, lower activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), higher level of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the liver and spleen. However, catalpol administration markedly reversed these effects of senescence induced by D-galactose. Simultaneously, catalpol noticeably elevated the decreased activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glutamine synthetase (GS), Na+-K+-ATPase, Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase and decreased the elevated activity of creatine kinase (CK) in mice liver or spleen. These results implied that the anti-aging effects of catalpol were achieved at least partly by promoting endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities and normalizing energy disturbance. Catalpol may be a potential anti-aging agent and worth testing for further preclinical study aimed for senescence or neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.

Primary cultured astrocytes exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by reperfusion (adding back oxygen and glucose, OGD-R), were used as an in vitro ischemic model. Treatment of the astrocytes with catalpol during ischemia-reperfusion increased astrocyte survival significantly in a concentration-dependent manner, as demonstrated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and morphological observation. In addition, catalpol prevented the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, inhibited the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the production of nitric oxide (NO), decreased the level of lipid peroxide and the activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and elevated the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and the content of glutathione (GSH).

When pH approaches the isoelectric point (pI) of BSA, results from both SANS and CFM suggest a loss of long-range interactions in BSA molecules.

Molecular studies reveal that EGY1 gene encodes a 59-kDa plastid-targeted metalloprotease. It is actively expressed in hypocotyl tissue and targets to endodermal and cortex plastid. Its protein level is up-regulated by both ethylene and light. CAB protein accumulation and chlorophyll level is severely reduced in hypocotyls and endodermal cells, respectively. Sucrose is able to restore the severely reduced starch and lipid contents as well as the deficient endodermal plastid size found in light-grown egy1 hypocotyls yet it fails to rescue the reduced plastid number and chlorophyll level in egy1 endodermal cells. The loss-of-function egy1 mutation results in a smaller size (1.9 +/- 0.3 mu m in diameter) and less number (5 +/- 1) of plastids in endodermal cells, which are nearly 50% of the wild-type. EGY1 is specially required for the development of full-size endodermal plastid in seedlings that are grown on sucrose-free media under light. It plays a direct role in controlling the light-induced chlorophyll production, grana formation and plastid replication in endodermal cell. However, it plays an indirect role in regulation of endodermal plastid size. It is likely that the ethylene-dependent gravitropism-deficient phenotype of egy1 hypocotyls may result from the smaller size and less number of endodermal plastids. Gravicurvature assays performed on ethylene-insensitive mutants, etr1-1, etr2-1, ers2-1, ein4-1 and ein2-5, have clearly demonstrated the necessary role for ethylene in vigorous gravitropism of light-grown hypocotyls. The degree of ethylene-dependent gravicurvature is positively correlated with the combined state of endodermal plastid mass and number. Neither ethylene nor EGY1-regulated full-size endodermal plastid is sufficient for promotion of vigorous hypocotyl gravitropism. Presence of 4 full-size plastids per endodermal cell together with ethylene pretreatment of hypocotyls becomes sufficient to trigger vigorous gravicurvature in light-grown seedlings. A model is therefore proposed to address the role of EGY1 in regulation of endodermal plastid size and number as well as the stimulatory effect of ethylene on hypocotyl gravitropism.","tags":["Arabidopsis; light-grown hypocotyls; EGY1; endodermal plastid; gravitropism; ethylene"],"title":"EGY1 plays a role in regulation of endodermal plastid size and number that are involved in ethylene-dependent gravitropism of light-grown Arabidopsis hypocotyls","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hongfei Li","Shichun Jiang","Zhaoyan Sun","Lijia An"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1204329600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067621,"objectID":"7c45eda0f5506c0f0a45de9f24ea518f","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000253737500003/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:33:41.277593Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000253737500003/","section":"publication","summary":"Molecular weight dependence of phase separation behavior of the Poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO)/Poly(ethylene oxide-block-dimethylsiloxane) (P(EO-b-DMS)) blends was investigated by both experimental and theoretical methods.

For a long time the Hoffman-Lauritzen model was always confronted by criticism,and some of the points were taken up and led to modifications, but the foundation remained unchanged which deemed that before the nucleation and crystallization the system was uniform. In this article the classical nucleation and growth theory of polymer crystallization was reviewed, and the confusion of the explanations to the polymer crystallization phenomenon was pointed out. LH theory assumes that the growth of lamellae is by the direct attachment of chain sequences from the melt onto smooth lateral sides. Whereas, more and more experimental results show that before the crystallite appears polymer chains go through conformation adjustment and orientation transformation which favor the formation of crystallites, i. e. a preordering structure exists before or at the early stage of polymer crystallization. This is a deviation from the simple process of nucleation and growth at the early stages of melt crystallization which can be gone back to Ostwald ` s `` rule of stages″. Strobl' s multi-step crystallization mechanism based on recent SAXS results was summarized in the paper. The theory assumes for the formation of polymer crystallites, a passage through a transient mesomorphic phase. It is proposed that the initial step is always the creation of a mesomorphic layer which starts with an attachment of chain sequences from the melt onto a growth face of a mesomorphic layer with minimum thickness and spontaneously thickens,up to a critical value, where it solidifies through a cooperative structural transition. The transition produces a granular crystalline layer, which transforms in the last step into homogeneous lamellar crystallites and this granular substructure is observed for many semicrystalline polymers. Crystallization of polymers is controlled by many factors which comprise of the variation of the main structural parameters such as lamellar thickness, long spacing, crystallinity with the crystallization temperature,the structural changes during recrystallization processes and the temperature dependence of growth rates etc. To expatiate upon the transforming process among melting, mesophase and lamellae a thermodynamics scheme was introduced. Many experiments indicate the existence of mesophase, and the thermodynamic framework by Strobl is generally feasible for many situations. Indeed, it is the interference of mesophase which generally dominants polymer crystallization by the selection of the lamellar thickness. Sirota argued that the granular structure of the lamellae was itself a fingerprint of the transient mesophase into which a lamella originally grew, and it was then converted to the higher-density stable form; and the lower interfacial energy of the mesophases is connected with their lower density. Based on Strobl ` s suggestion two crystallization modes of mesophase forming polymers have been offered which were partitioned by crystallization rates and only the second case by high rates was deemed to apply to the Ostwald's rule of stages. In conclusion, it is very important to newly understand the polymer crystallization process for the thermodynamical properties of the mesophase between melting and crystallite.","tags":["polymer crystallization; mesophase; precursor structure; lamellae"],"title":"The new concepts and new developments in hte theory of polymer crystallization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lin Xu","Xifei Yu","Tongfei Shi","Lijia An"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067622,"objectID":"03ca4f83ea5d91cbc2499c6d65a30a95","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000252045600005/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:33:42.208554Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000252045600005/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Dewetting of linear polymer/star polymer blend film","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuxi Jia","Guofang Zhan","Lili Wu","Sheng Sun","Guoqun Zhao","Lijia An"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1196467200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067623,"objectID":"99d39c6d5900ad462e4a444a812f88cb","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000251014600011/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:33:43.151253Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000251014600011/","section":"publication","summary":"In the reactive extrusion process for polymerization, the chemical calorific effect has a great influence on the temperature.

This finding demonstrates that Gln49-PLA(2) is consistent with thrombin-like properties, and therefore should be a new thrombin-like serine protease.","tags":["gloydius ussurensis; phospholipase A(2); serine protease; snake venom; thrombin-like"],"title":"Identification of a novel thrombin-like phospholipase A(2) from Gloydius ussuriensis snake venom","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guofang Zhang","Yuxi Jia","Sheng Sun","Lih Wu","Guoqun Zhao","Lijia An"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1193875200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067625,"objectID":"dc4b837c44419287a84557f69f18f955","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000251872200002/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:33:44.565164Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000251872200002/","section":"publication","summary":"The free radical grafting of polyethylene with vinyl monomers by reactive extrusion was studied numerically.

The scattering data confirm on the one hand the model proposed by Peterlin on the static structure of oriented polyethylene being composed of oriented fibrils, which are built by bundles of micro-fibrils. On the other hand it was found that deformation is mediated by the slippage of the micro-fibrils and not the slippage of the fibrils. In the micro-fibrils, the polymer chains are highly oriented both in the crystalline and in the amorphous regions. When stretching beyond the natural draw ratio mainly slippage of micro-fibrils past each other takes place. The thickness of the interlamellar amorphous layers increases only slightly. The coupling force between micro-fibrils increases during stretching due to inter-microfibrillar polymer segments being stretched taut thus increasingly impeding further sliding of the micro-fibrils leading finally to slippage of the fibrils.

Increasing the solvent molecular size leads to shrinkage of the polymer chains and increase of the critical overlap concentrations. The root-mean-square radius of gyration of polymer chains (R-g) is less sensitive to the variation of polymer concentration in solutions of larger solvent molecules. In addition, the dependency of R-g on polymer concentration under normal solvent conditions and solvent molecular size is in good agreement with scaling laws. When the solvent molecular size approaches the ideal end-to-end distance of the polymer chain, an extra aggregation of polymer chains occurs, and the solvent becomes the so-called medium-sized solvent. When the size of solvent molecules is smaller than the medium size, the polymer chains are swollen or partially swollen. However, when the size of solvent molecules is larger than the medium size, the polymer coils shrink and segregate, enwrapped by the large solvent molecules.

By changing the ratios of the volume fractions of two A arms and two C arms, one can obtain block copolymers with different architectures ranging from linear block copolymer to H-shaped block copolymer. By systematically varying the volume fractions of block A, B, and C, the triangle phase diagrams of the H-shaped ABC block copolymer with equal interactions among the three species are constructed. In this study, we find four different morphologies ( lamellar phase ( LAM), hexagonal lattice phase ( HEX), core-shell hexagonal lattice phase (CSH), and two interpenetrating tetragonal lattice (TET2)). Furthermore, the order-order transitions driven by architectural change are discussed.","tags":[],"title":"Comparing the morphology and phase diagram of H-shaped ABC block copolymers and linear ABC block copolymers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiyan Du","Zhaoyan Sun","Lijia An"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1149120000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1657067642,"objectID":"e783780b8c263f3b7c20c53dc4ae8a95","permalink":"https://anljteam.github.io/publication/wos-000238373000006/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:34:02.3439Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000238373000006/","section":"publication","summary":"The chain-length dependence of the Flory-Huggins (FH) interaction parameter is introduced into the FH lattice theory for polydisperse polymer-blend systems.

In order to check the validity of this approach, an epoxy-matrix monolayer composite was used as thermosetting polymer-matrix composite and a polypropylene (PP)-matrix monolayer composite was used as thermoplastic polymer-matrix composite, respectively. It is found that the stress concentrations near the broken fiber element cause damage to the neighboring epoxy matrix prior to the breakage of other fibers, whereas in the case of PP-matrix composites the fibers nearest to the broken fiber break prior to the PP matrix damage, because the PP matrix around the broken fiber element yields. In order to simulate composite damage evolution, a Monte Carlo technique based on a finite element method has been developed in the paper. The finite element code coupled with statistical model of fiber strength specifically written for this problem was used to determine the stress redistribution. Five hundred samples of numerical simulation were carried out to obtain statistical deformation and failure process of composites with fixed fiber volume fraction. The result indicates that the moderate interfacial shear sliding strength can weaken the adverse effect of fiber breaks on composite strength, resulting in the increase of the average strength of composites.
